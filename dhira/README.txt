Scala based Artificial Neural Network exploration at its infancy!

Inspired by https://github.com/prnicolas/ScalaMl

Linear Algebra:
- [Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze)

OpenCL for GPU integration:
- [ScalaCL](https://github.com/nativelibs4java/ScalaCL)i

We shall explore Neural Network libraries:
- [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/)
- [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks.html)
- [cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
- [deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/)
