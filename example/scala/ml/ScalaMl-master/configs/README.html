<h2>Scala for Machine Learning - Configurations</h2>
<hr>
<p>
This directory is to be used to store (resp. load) configuration of machine algorithm, inheriting from the trait, <b>Config</b> into (resp. from) a file.<br>
For instance the configuration for the Multi-layer perceptron is defined by the class org.scalaml.supervised.nnet.<b>MLPModel</b> and can be stored into the <b>configs/MLPModel</b>.<br>
The persistency design is presented only for the sake of illustrating the concept and is not currently implemented for any of the machine learning algorithms. 
The reader is invited to create a robust, generic implementation for all the models presented in the book.

<h3>Declaration:</h3>
<pre>
trait Config {
  protected def write(content: String): Boolean  = 
	FileUtils.write(content, Config.RELATIVE_PATH, getClass.getSimpleName)
   
   // Save these configuration parameters into a file configs/getClass.getSimpleName	
  def >> : Boolean = false
}

object Config {
  private val RELATIVE_PATH = "configs/"
  def read(className: String): Option[String] = FileUtils.read(RELATIVE_PATH, className)
