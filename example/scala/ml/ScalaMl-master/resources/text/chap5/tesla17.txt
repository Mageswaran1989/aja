Tesla Motors Inc CEO Musk, Johnny Depp Stopped For Speeding 

Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is known not only for making electric cars, but also fancy, fast, sports cars. Most people who have driven one say the car is extremely fun to drive, so naturally, Johnny Depp was inclined to take a ride with CEO Elon Musk.
According to the Sun, Transcendence director Wally Pfister introduced Musk to Depp when Musk visited the set of the movie. Of course Musk offered to take them for a ride, and he ended up driving not only Depp and Pfister, but also Rebecca Hall and Paul Bettany, who also play roles in the movie.
Depp told the Sun that riding in the Model S was “one of the best experiences” he has ever had. He had never ridden in the car before.
While they were out and about, apparently Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Elon Musk got a little too excited about the car and pushed it over the speed limit. According to Depp, Musk had a “good sense of humor about it,” but the cop didn’t. About the police officer, Depp said, “He needed a humor chip.”
Apparently speeding may not have been the only thing which caught the police officer’s attention, as Transport Evolved notes. Apparently Paul Bettany was sitting in Johnny Depp’s lap at the time.
So naturally people will be wondering if or when Depp will be ordering his own Model S. Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could use a big name in Hollywood to support its car, particularly after George Clooney publicly bashed the company’s first electric vehicle, the Roadster, saying that he hated it and that he spent more time on the side of the road than he did actually driving it.
Filming for Transcendence is over, and the film will be in theaters this week, so the incident must have happened some time ago, even though this is the first we are hearing of it.
