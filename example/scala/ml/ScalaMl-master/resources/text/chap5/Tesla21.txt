Tesla Motors, Inc.: A First-Quarter 2014 Review

Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ: TSLA  ) growth story continues to accelerate in 2014, though there have been many twists and turns in the road. The abundance of news that comes out about the electric-vehicle maker can make it challenging to keep up to date. So a summary of the notable events involving Tesla during the first quarter of 2014 might prove handy.

First, a word about Tesla's stock: It's up 41% since the start of 2014, and has gained 460% in the past year. While there's no doubt that the stock is "overvalued" using conventional valuation measures -- its forward P/E is 54.7, for instance -- it's also true that nearly all turbocharged growth stocks are overvalued while in their early high-growth phases.

Growth accelerates with release of Q4 earnings and 2014 guidance
In February, Tesla announced fourth-quarter 2013 results that crushed analysts' estimates, and provided better-than-expected 2014 guidance. The company's adjusted earnings were $0.33 per share, handily topping the $0.21 consensus, while its revenue rose nearly 150% from the year-ago period to $761 million, also beating the $677 million analysts had expected.

Tesla met its gross margin goal of 25% (excluding sales credits for zero-emission-vehicles), as its adjusted gross margin was 25.2%, while gross margin on a GAAP basis was 25.8%. For context, BMW's and Daimler's gross margins are 19.9% and 21.5%, respectively, over the trailing-12-month period. Tesla expects to improve its gross margin to 28% by the end of this year.

The company delivered 6,892 Model S sedans in the quarter, and 22,477 vehicles for the full year. If all goes according to plan, 35,000 folks should become Model S owners in 2014.

Supercharger build-out continues
There are now 82 Supercharger stations in North America. Tesla's goal is to have 80% of the U.S. population and parts of Canada covered by the end of this year, and 98% coverage by 2015.

Tesla has 14 stations in Europe, where it's systematically building out coverage. It started with Norway and is now focused on Germany, which it plans to have fully covered this year. Additionally, it plans to have full coverage in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, and Luxembourg, and about 90% coverage in England, Wales, and Sweden by year's end.

"Gigafactory" plans announced On the heels of its earnings release, Tesla announced details about its plans to build a massive battery factory. The goal of the "Gigafactory" is to reduce Tesla's battery cell costs much faster than would otherwise be possible. By 2020, Tesla expects its factory to be able to produce more lithium-ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013, and enough to supply it with batteries to manufacture 500,000 vehicles per year. By the end of 2017, which is the first year the mass market "Gen III" vehicle will be manufactured, Tesla anticipates that the Gigafactory will have driven down the per-kWh cost of its battery pack by more than 30%.

The four states competing to house the $4 billion-$5 billion Gigafactory, which is expected to provide about 6,500 jobs, are Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas
