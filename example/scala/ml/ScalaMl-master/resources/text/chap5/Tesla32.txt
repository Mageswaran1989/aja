Tesla Motors: CBS ’60 Minutes’ Admits Audio Editing Error

Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s flagship Model S sedan is one of the fastest and quietest vehicles on the road. But a CBS 60 Minutes interview with Tesla founder Elon Musk, which aired on Sunday, gives the wrong impression of the car. Now CBS has acknowledged that it was an error. After the introductory section by Scott Pelley, the episode shows a series of shots of the Model S driving down the road. The driving footage has motor noises and shifting of the transmission. What’s more, the gear-shifting sounds were out-of-sync with the Model S.
Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Model S has none of these sounds. Prominent automotive blog Jalopnik.com said it looks like they recorded a motorcycle engine sound and used it with the Model S footage. Or perhaps the drive-along camera was on a motorcycle. The sounds seem strange. The engine noise can also be noticed in multiple shots of a stationary Model S interior that was recorded in a studio setting. Tesla’ electric car is propelled by an electric motor that releases an unnoticeable whirring noise.
Again, footage of Model S going through Norway’s Lærdal Tunnel includes engine sounds in the background. The same footage is presented on Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s YouTube page with an entirely different audio, which is in line with the vehicle’s actual sound. Besides Jalopnik, many viewers also noted the difference.
CBS regrets video editing error in its Tesla report
On Monday, a CBS representative told FoxNews that their video editor made an audio editing error, and it was being corrected online. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Elon Musk have opted to remain silent on the issue, just like their Model S luxury sedan.
Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock inched up 0.72% to $209.95 in pre-market trading Tuesday.
