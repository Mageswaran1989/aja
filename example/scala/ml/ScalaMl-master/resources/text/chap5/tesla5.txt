Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) delivers the Model S to China with huge potential.  It’s got a couple of things going for it in the fact that china is a huge market, as well as the pump for e.v.s. 
The selling price is approximately $122,000, which iknow that sounds expensive, but most people are saying that’s not a bad deal compared to other luxury vehicles in china.
“Tesla probably will invest several hundred million dollars in charging infrastructure in China, Musk told reporters. He said it will open several hundred service centers,” Joe McDonald Reports. ”My instructions to the team are to spend money as fast as they can spend it without wasting it,” he said.
McDonald goes on to say, “Customers received the first Model S sedans at a brief ceremony at Tesla’s office in a Beijing industrial park, also the site of its first Chinese charging station.”
“I’m incredibly appreciative of customers like you for taking a chance on a new product from a new company,” Musk told them. “Without customers like you, we would have no chance.”
