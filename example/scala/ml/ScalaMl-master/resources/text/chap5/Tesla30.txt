Tesla - 20 Key Risks That Longs Are Ignoring

With a market cap approaching $27,000,000,000, Tesla (TSLA) is priced to perfection. Anyone who believes that Tesla is a buy or a hold at these levels must believe that Tesla is coated with Teflon and will execute its business plan flawlessly forever with little in the way of competition; in short, that nothing bad can ever happen to the company. While any investment requires a certain degree of faith, blind faith in any stock is usually a recipe for disaster. Set forth below are 20 key risks to Tesla's current stock valuation that I believe Tesla longs have not fully appreciated (if at all). If and when the market absorbs the fact that these (and other) risks actually exist for Tesla, I believe that Tesla's market valuation will be repriced much lower.

1. Tesla is Overvalued Using any Reasonable Valuation Metric

Analysis: CEO Elon Musk admitted several months ago that the "stock price that [Tesla has] is more than we have any right to deserve." At the time, the stock price was approximately $40 below the current price. When the CEO of a public company makes an openly bearish comment regarding his or her own company or industry, longs should sit up and take notice, as this is quite a rare occurrence. While such candor should be commended, it does not bode well for Tesla's stock price. As regards Musk's bearish commentary, Tesla longs appear to have adopted the ostrich approach, pretending as if Musk never said this. An analogous situation occurred in mid-2011, when shipper Frontline's (FRO) chairman and largest shareholder was quoted as being unambiguously bearish regarding his own industry. Since then, FRO's market capitalization has plummeted over 70%.
