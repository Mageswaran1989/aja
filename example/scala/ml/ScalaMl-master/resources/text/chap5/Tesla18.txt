Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to begin production in China, invest in charging infrastructure

Tesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk said his company will begin building cars in China within the next three to four years, and it will make a "big investment" in China's charging infrastructure, including superchargers in Beijing and Shanghai.
Bloomberg reports Musk made the announcement at the Geekpark conference in Beijing, China, where Tesla is preparing to roll out deliveries of its Model S sedan.
The vehicles it delivers in China, though, will be more costly for consumers than their American and European counterparts. Shipping charges, value-added taxes and import duties mean a Model S with an 85-kilowatt battery will cost about $118,000 compared to the $71,000 it costs in the U.S. 
Producing the cars locally means Tesla can sidestep some of these costs, like China's 25 percent import tariff. China, the world's largest auto market, is lagging in its target of hitting 5 million alternative energy-powered vehicles by 2020, according to Bloomberg.
