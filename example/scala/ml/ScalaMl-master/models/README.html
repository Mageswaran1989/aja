<h2>Scala for Machine Learning - Models</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Directory used to store and load some of the machine learning models described in the book.<br>
A model is saved into (resp. restored from) file which name is the name of the class of the model, which inherits from the trait <b>Model</b>.
For instance, a model generated through training of a conditional random field is defined as org.scalaml.supervised.crf.<b>CrfModel</b> and saved 
into the file <b>models/CrfModel</b><br>
The persistency design is implemented for only few models to illustrate the concept. The reader is invited to create a more robust, generic implementation for all the models presented in the book.
</p>
<h3>Declaration:</h3>
<pre>
trait Model {
  protected def write(content: String): Boolean  = 
	FileUtils.write(content, Model.MODEL_RELATIVE_PATH, getClass.getSimpleName)
   
   // Save this model into a file models/getClass.getSimpleName	
  def >> : Boolean = false
}

object Model {
  private val MODEL_RELATIVE_PATH = "models/"
  def read(className: String): Option[String] = FileUtils.read(MODEL_RELATIVE_PATH, className)
}</pre>

<h3>Example:</h3>
The model for the conditional random field is defined as
<pre>
final protected class <b>CrfModel</b>(val weights: DblVector) extends Model</pre>
This constructor takes an vector of weights and is generated through training.
The parameters of the model, weights, are stored in file using the Model.>> method as follows:
<pre>
override def <b>>></b> : Boolean = write(weights.mkString(","))
</pre>
An instance of the model, CrfModel, is created from file instead from training, using the second constructor that takes the name of the class of the model as argument.
<pre>
def this(className: String) = 
  this({ Model.read(className).map( _.split(",").map(_.toDouble)).getOrElse(Array.empty) })
</pre>
