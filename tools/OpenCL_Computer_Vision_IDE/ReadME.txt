OpenCL Computer Vision IDE:
===========================

Looking for some easy way of learning OpenCL, where you can concentrate more 
on kernels and less on setting up the code environment for the tough 
exercises, you have taken up. You might be in the right place!

i-Vizon presents its little contribution towards your first step in learning OpenCL :)
Motivation is to run OpenCV CL kernels with minimum effort to maximize the learning curve.

IDE Features:
* Create OpenCL exercise project.
* Configure your CPP code to use Camera/Images which internally uses OpenCV.
* Set the kernel name.
* Set the kernel arguments, type and input data.
* Generate your kernel file.
* Edit your kernel file.
* Compile your kernel file.
* Test your OpenCL exercise project.

Best part is the generated code can be directly compiled with prefered cross compilers,
to test it in embedded platforms.

i-Vizon Assumptions:
===================
* You are a good Linux Programmer
	* C
	* C++	
	* MakeFiles
	* Linux APIs (pthread, time, etc.,)
* You know how to install softwares/libraries in Ubuntu
	* OpenCV
	* OpenCL
	* OpenGLES v2
* You are familiar with Qt Creator (C++ Editor & Compiler)
* You are a Linux geek in short :)
