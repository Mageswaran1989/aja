Hopfield networks are constructed from artificial neurons Figure~\ref{fig:simple_hopfield_network}. These
artificial neurons have N inputs. With each input $i$ there is a weight $w_i$ associated.
They also have an output. The state of the output is maintained, until
the neuron is updated. Updating the neuron entails the following operations:
	
\begin{itemize}
\item The value of each input, $x_i$ is determined and the weighted sum of all inputs,\(\vspace{2mm} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n {w_ix_i}\) is calculated.
\item The output state of the neuron is set to $+1$ if the weighted input sum is
larger or equal to $0$. It is set to $-1$ if the weighted input sum is smaller
than $0$.
\item A neuron retains its output state until it is updated again.
\end{itemize}

Written as formula: \\*
\[ o = \left\{ 
               \begin{array}{l l}
               \hspace{3 mm} 1  : & \quad \sum_{i} w_ix_i >= 0 \\
                            -1  : & \quad \sum_{i} w_ix_i < 0
               \end{array} 
       \right.
\]
  
  
A Hopfield network is a network of $N$ such artificial neurons, which are fully
connected. The connection weight from neuron $j$ to neuron $i$ is given by a
number $w$$_i$$_j$. The collection of all such numbers is represented by the weight
matrix $W$, whose components are $w$$_i$$_j$.

Now given the weight matrix and the updating rule for neurons the dynamics
of the network is defined if we tell in which order we update the neurons. There
are two ways of updating them:

\begin {itemize}
\item \textbf{Asynchronous}: one picks one neuron, calculates the weighted input sum
and updates immediately. This can be done in a fixed order, or neurons
can be picked at random, which is called asynchronous random updating.
\item \textbf{Synchronous}: the weighted input sums of all neurons are calculated without
updating the neurons. Then all neurons are set to their new value,
according to the value of their weighted input sum. The lecture slides
contain an explicit example of synchronous updating.
\end{itemize}

\section {Use of the Hopfield network}
The way in which the Hopfield network is used is as follows. 
A pattern is entered in the network by setting all nodes to a specific value, or by setting
only part of the nodes. The network is then subject to a number of iterations
using asynchronous or synchronous updating. This is stopped after a while.
The network neurons are then read out to see which pattern is in the network.
The idea behind the Hopfield network is that patterns are stored in the
weight matrix. The input must contain part of these patterns. The dynamics
of the network then retrieve the patterns stored in the weight matrix. This is
called \textbf{Content Addressable Memory (CAM)}. The network can also be used for
auto-association. The patterns that are stored in the network are divided in two
parts: \textbf{cue} and \textbf{association}. By entering the cue into the network,
the entire pattern, which is stored in the weight matrix, is retrieved. In this
way the network restores the association that belongs to a given cue.
The stage is now almost set for the Hopfield network, we must only decide
how we determine the weight matrix. We will do that in the next section, but
in general we always impose two conditions on the weight matrix:
\begin{itemize}
\item Symmetry : $w$$_i$$_j$ = $w$$_i$$_j$
\item No self connections: $w$$_i$$_i$ = 0
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{A two-neuron network}
\caption{There are just two options for the weight
matrix: $w_{i,j}$ = 1  or $w_{i,j}$ = -1. If the weight is 1, there are two stable
states under synchronous updating \{+1, +1\}, or \{-1, -1\}. For a weight of -1,
the stable states will be \{-1, +1\} or \{+1, -1\} depending on initial conditions.
Under synchrononous updating the states are oscillatory.}
\label{fig:a_two_neuron_network}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=1cm,semithick]
    \node[input neuron] (N1) at (0,0) {1};
    \node[input neuron] (N2) at (4,0) {2};

    \path ([yshift= .5ex]N1.east) edge node[above] {$w_1$$_2$} ([yshift= .5ex]N2.west);
    \path ([yshift=-.5ex]N2.west) edge node[below] {$w_2$$_1$}([yshift=-.5ex]N1.east);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

It turns out that we can guarantee that the network converges under asynchronous
updating when we use these conditions

\section{Training the network}
\subsection{A Simple Example}

Consider the two nodes in Fig~\ref{fig:a_two_neuron_network} Depending on which values they contain initially they will reach end states {+1, +1} or {-1,-1} under asynchronous
updating. \\
This simple example illustrates two important aspects of the Hopfield network:
the steady final state is determined by the value of the weight and the
network is ’sign-blind’; it depends on the initial conditions which final state will
be reached, \{+1,+1\} or \{-1, -1\} Figure~\ref{fig:a_two_neuron_network}.

\section{Setting the weight matrix}
\subsection{A single pattern}
Consider two neurons. If the weight between them is positive, then they will
tend to drive each other in the same direction: this is clear from the two-neuron
network in the example. It is also true in larger networks: suppose we have
neuron $i$ connected to neuron $j$ with a weight of $+1$, then the contribution of
neuron $i$ to the weighted input sum of neuron $j$ is \textbf{positive} if $x_i$ = $1$ and negative if $x = -1$. In other words neuron, $i$ tries to drive neuron $j$ to the same value as it has currently. If the connection weights between them is negative, however,
neuron $i$ will try to drive neuron $j$ to the opposite value! This inspires the
choice of the Hebb rule: given a network of N nodes and faced with a pattern
$~x = (x_1, ..., x_N )$ that we want to store in the network, we chose the values of
the weight matrix as follows:
\[ 
 w_{i,j} = x_ix_j
\]

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

To see how this works out in a network of four nodes, consider Figure~\ref{fig:a_two_neuron_network}. Note
that weights are optimal for this example in the sense that if the pattern (1, -1,
1, 1) is present in the network, each input node receives the maximal or minimal
(in the case of neuron 2) input some possible!
We can actually prove this: suppose the pattern $\vec{x}$, which has been used to
train the network, is present in the network and we update neuron i, what will
happen? The weighted input sum of a node is often denoted by $h_i = \sum_j w_{i,j}x_j$ ,
which is called the local field. If $w_{ij}$ was chosen to store this very same pattern,
we can calculate $h_i$:
\[
h_i = \sum_j w_{i,j}x_ix_j = \sum_{j=1}^3 = x_ix_jx_j = x_i + x_i + x_i = 3x_i 
\]

This is true for all nodes i. So all other three nodes (self connections are
forbidden!) in the network give a summed contribution of $3x_i$. This means that $x_i$ will never change value, the pattern is stable!

\[
h_i = \sum_j w_{i,j}v_j = - \sum_j w_{i,j}x_j = - \sum_j x_ix_jx_j = -\sum^3_{j=1} x_i = −3x_i = 3v_i
\]
Again, this pattern is maximally stable: the Hopfield network is ’sign-blind’.

\subsection{Weight Determination}
How to determine weight matrix for multiple patters? You can go about this in the following way.
\subsubsection{Binary to Bipolar Mapping}
By replacing each $0$ in a binary string with a $-1$, you get the corresponding bipolar string.
\[
f(x) = 2x - 1
\]
For inverse mapping, which turns a bipolar string into a binary string, you use
the following function:
\[
f(x) = (x + 1) / 2
\]
\subsubsection{Pattern’s Contribution to Weight}
We work with the bipolar versions of the input patterns. We take each
pattern to be recalled, one at a time, and determine its contribution to the
weight matrix of the network. The contribution of each pattern is itself a
matrix. The size of such a matrix is the same as the weight matrix of the
network. Then add these contributions, in the way matrices are added, and you
end up with the weight matrix for the network, which is also referred to as the
correlation matrix. Let us find the contribution of the pattern $A = (1, 0, 1, 0)$:
First, we notice that the binary to bipolar mapping of $A = (1, 0, 1, 0)$ gives the
vector $(1, –1, 1, –1)$.
Then we take the transpose, and multiply, the way matrices are multiplied, and
we see the following:

\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
\matplus1  \\
-1  \\
\matplus1  \\
-1  \\
\end{bmatrix}
*
\begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus1 & -1 & \matplus1 & -1  \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 & -1 \\
-1 &  \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 \\
 \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 & -1 \\
-1 & \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now subtract $1$ from each element in the main diagonal (that runs from top left
to bottom right). This operation gives the same result as subtracting the
identity matrix from the given matrix, obtaining $0$’s in the main diagonal. The
resulting matrix, which is given next, is the contribution of the pattern $(1, 0, 1,
0)$ to the weight matrix.
\[
 W_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus0 & -1 &  \matplus1 & -1 \\
-1 &  \matplus0 & -1 &  \matplus1 \\
 \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus0 & -1 \\
-1 &  \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Similarly, we can calculate the contribution from the pattern \\ $B = (0, 1, 0, 1)$ its bipolar version $B = (-1, 1, -1, 1)$ by verifying that pattern B's contribution is the same matrix as pattern A's contribution.

\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
 -1  \\
  \matplus1  \\
 -1  \\
  \matplus1  \\
\end{bmatrix}
*
\begin{bmatrix}
 -1 & 1 & -1 & 1  \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 & -1 \\
-1 &  \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 \\
 \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 & -1 \\
-1 &  \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
W_2 =
\begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus0 & -1 &  \matplus1 & -1 \\
-1 &  \matplus0 & -1 &  \matplus1 \\
 \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus0 & -1 \\
-1 &  \matplus1 & -1 &  \matplus0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
W_1 + W_2 =
\begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus0 & -2 &  \matplus2 & -2 \\
-2 &  \matplus0 & -2 &  \matplus2 \\
 \matplus1 & -2 &  \matplus0 & -2 \\
-2 &  \matplus1 & -2 &  \matplus0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
We can now optionally apply an arbitrary scalar multiplier to all the entries of
the matrix if you wish. This is shown in the \ref{sec:example_a_simple_hopfield_network}.
\subsubsection{Autoassociative Network}
The Hopfield network just shown has the feature that the network associates an
input pattern with itself in recall. This makes the network an \textbf{autoassociative}
network. The patterns used for determining the proper weight matrix are also
the ones that are \textbf{autoassociatively} recalled. These patterns are called the
exemplars. A pattern other than an exemplar may or may not be recalled by the
network. Of course, when you present the pattern $0 0 0 0$, it is stable, even
though it is not an exemplar pattern.
\subsubsection{Orthogonal Bit Patterns}
You may be wondering how many patterns the network with four nodes is able
to recall. Let us first consider how many different bit patterns are orthogonal to
a given bit pattern. This question really refers to bit patterns in which at least
one bit is equal to 1. A little reflection tells us that if two bit patterns are to be
orthogonal, they cannot both have $1$'s in the same position, since the dot
product would need to be $0$. In other words, a bitwise logical $AND$ operation
of the two bit patterns has to result in a $0$. This suggests the following. If a
pattern $P$ has $k$, less than $4$, bit positions with $0$ (and so $4-k$ bit positions with
$1$), and if pattern $Q$ is to be orthogonal to $P$, then $Q$ can have $0$ or $1$ in those $k$ positions, but it must have only $0$ in the rest $4-k$ positions. Since there are two
choices for each of the $k$ positions, there are $2^k$ possible patterns orthogonal to
$P$. This number $2^k$ of patterns includes the pattern with all zeroes. So there
really are $2^k-1$ non-zero patterns orthogonal to $P$. Some of these $2^k-1$ patterns are not orthogonal to each other. As an example, $P$ can be the pattern (0 1 0 0),
which has $k=3$ positions with $0$. There are $2^3-1=7$ nonzero patterns
orthogonal to (0 1 0 0). Among these are patterns (1 0 1 0) and (1 0 0 1), which are
not orthogonal to each other, since their dot product is $1$ and not $0$.

\subsubsection{Network Nodes and Input Patterns}
Since our network has four neurons in it, it also has four nodes in the directed
graph that represents the network. These are laterally connected because
connections are established from node to node. They are lateral because the
nodes are all in the same layer. We started with the patterns A = (1, 0, 1, 0)
and B = (0, 1, 0, 1) as the exemplars. If we take any other nonzero pattern that
is orthogonal to A, it will have a 1 in a position where B also has a 1. So the
new pattern will not be orthogonal to B. Therefore, the orthogonal set of
patterns that contains A and B can have only those two as its elements. If you
remove B from the set, you can get (at most) two others to join A to form an
orthogonal set. They are the patterns (0, 1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 0, 1).
If you follow the procedure described earlier to get the correlation matrix, you
will get the following weight matrix:


\[ 
W = \begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus0 & -1         &  \matplus3 & -1 \\
  -1       &  \matplus0 &  -1        &  -1 \\
 \matplus3 & -1         &  \matplus0 & -1 \\
-1         &  -1        & -1         &  \matplus0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

With this matrix, pattern A is recalled, but the zero pattern (0, 0, 0, 0) is
obtained for the two patterns (0, 1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 0, 1). Once the zero pattern
is obtained, its own recall will be stable.

\section{Energy}
We can define an energy for each node:
\[
E_i = - \frac{1}{2}h_ix_i
\]

Note that the energy is positive if the sign of $h_i$ and $x_i$
is different! An update of node i will result in a sign change in this case because the local field $h_i$ has a different sign. The updating will change the energy form a positive number
to a negative number. This corresponds to the intuitive idea that stable states
have a low energy. We can define an energy for the entire network:

\[
E(\vec{x}) = \sum_i E_i = - \sum_{i,j}\frac{1}{2}h_ix_i = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}x_ix_j
\]

Again, it is clear that for the pattern that has been used to train the weight
matrix the energy is minimal. In this case:

\[
E = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}x_ix_j = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j}x_ix_jx_j = -\frac{1}{2}
\sum_{i,j}1 = -\frac{1}{2}(N-1)^2
\]
\section{Stability of a single pattern}
So far we have looked at the situation where the same patterns was in the
network that was used to train the network. Now let us assume that another
pattern is in the network. It is pattern $\vec{y}$ which is the same as pattern $\vec{x}$ except for three nodes. The network, as usual, has $N$ nodes. No we are updating a
node $i$ of the network. What is the local field? It is given by:

\[
h_i = \sum_j w_{i,j}y_j = \sum_j x_ix_jy_j 
\]

We can split this sum in 3 nodes, which have an opposite value of $\vec{x}$ and
$N − 3$ nodes which have the same value:

\[
h_i = \sum^{N-3}_{j=1} x_ix_jx_j + \sum^3_{j=1} x_ix_j · -x_j = (N - 3)x_i - 3x_i = (N - 6)x_i
\]

For $N > 6$ all the local fields point the direction of $x_i$, the pattern that was
used to define the weight matrix!. So updating will result in no change (if the
value of node i is equal to $x_i$) or an update (if the value of node $i$ is equal to
$-x_i$). So, the pattern that is stored into the network is stable: up to half of the
nodes can be inverted and the network will still reproduce $\vec{x}$.

%There is also another way to look at this. The pattern that was used to train
%the network is an absolute energy minimum. This follows from equation 6. One
%can show the following important proposition, which is true for any symmetric
%weight matrix.
%
%Proposition 1:
%The energy of a Hopfield network can only decrease or stay the same. If an
%update cause a neuron to change sign, then the energy will decrease, otherwise
%it will stay the same.
%The condition that the energy of a Hopfield network can only decrease only rests
%on the condition that the weight matrix is symmetric. This is true for the Heb
%rule and also the generalised Hebb rule (see below). The undergraduates need
%not know this proof, but the postgraduates must be able to reproduce it. We
%will proof proposition 1 in section A.
%Since there is only one absolute minimum in a Hopfield network that has
%been trained with a single pattern (equation 6 is proof of that) and the minimum
%is reached when the training pattern (or its negative inverse; the same pattern
%with multiplied by -1) is in the network, the network must converge to the
%trained pattern (or its negative inverse).

\subsection {Example — A Simple Hopfield Network}
\label{sec:example_a_simple_hopfield_network}
A simple single layer Hopfield network is created with four neurons. We place, in
this layer, four neurons, each connected to the rest, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:single_layer_hopfield_network}. Some of the connections have a positive weight, 
and the rest have a negative weight. The network
will be presented with two input patterns, one at a time, and it is supposed to recall them.
The inputs would be binary patterns having in each component a 0 or 1. If two patterns
of equal length are given and are treated as vectors, their dot product is obtained by first
multiplying corresponding components together and then adding these products. Two
vectors are said to be orthogonal, if their dot product is 0. The mathematics involved in
computations done for neural networks include matrix multiplication, transpose of a
matrix, and transpose of a vector. The inputs (which are stable, stored patterns) to be given should be orthogonal to one another.

The two patterns we want the network to recall are $A = (1, 0, 1, 0)$ and $B = (0, 1, 0, 1)$,
which you can verify to be orthogonal. Recall that two vectors A and B are orthogonal if
their dot product is equal to zero. This is true in this case since

$A_1$$B_1$ + $A_2$$B_2$ + $A_3$$B_3$ + $A_4$$B_4$ = $(1\times0 + 0\times1 + 1\times0 + 0\times1) = 0$

The following matrix W gives the weights on the connections in the network.

\[ 
W = \begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus0 & -3 &  \matplus3 & -3 \\
-3 &  \matplus0 & -3 &  \matplus3 \\
 \matplus3 & -3 &  \matplus0 & -3 \\
-3 &  \matplus3 & -3 &  \matplus0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

We need a threshold function also, and we define it as follows. The threshold value $\theta$ is 0.

\[ f(t) = \left\{ 
                  \begin{array}{l l}
                   1 & \mbox{if $t \geq \theta$}\\
                   0 & \mbox{if $t < \theta$}
                  \end{array} 
          \right. 
\]
 
 
 We have four neurons in the only layer in this network. We need to compute
the activation of each neuron as the weighted sum of its inputs. The activation
at the first node is the dot product of the input vector and the first column of
the weight matrix (0 -3 3 -3). We get the activation at the other nodes
similarly. The output of a neuron is then calculated by evaluating the threshold
function at the activation of the neuron. So if we present the input vector A,
the dot product works out to 3 and f(3) = 1. Similarly, we get the dot products
of the second, third, and fourth nodes to be -6, 3, and -6, respectively. The
corresponding outputs therefore are 0, 1, and 0. This means that the output of
the network is the vector (1, 0, 1, 0), same as the input pattern. The network
has recalled the pattern as presented, or we can say that pattern A is stable,
since the output is equal to the input. When B is presented, the dot product
obtained at the first node is -6 and the output is 0. The outputs for the rest of
the nodes taken together with the output of the first node gives (0, 1, 0, 1),
which means that the network has stable recall for B also.

So far we have presented easy cases to the network—vectors that the Hopfield
network was specifically designed (through the choice of the weight matrix) to
recall. What will the network give as output if we present a pattern different
from both A and B? Let C = (0, 1, 0, 0) be presented to the network. The
activations would be -3, 0, -3, 3, making the outputs 0, 1, 0, 1, which means
that B achieves stable recall. This is quite interesting. Suppose we did intend to
input B and we made a slight error and ended up presenting C, instead. The
network did what we wanted and recalled B. But why not A? To answer this,
let us ask is C closer to A or B? How do we compare? We use the distance
formula for two four-dimensional points. If (a, b, c, d) and (e, f, g, h) are two
four-dimensional points, the distance between them is:

\[\sqrt{(a – e)^2 + (b – f)^2 + (c – g)^2 + (d – h)^2}\]

The distance between A and C is $\sqrt{3}$, whereas the distance between B and
C is just 1. So since B is closer in this sense, B was recalled rather than A. You
may verify that if we do the same exercise with D = (0, 0, 1, 0), we will see
that the network recalls A, which is closer than B to D.


\section{Asynchronous Update}

The Hopfield network is a recurrent network. This means that outputs from
the network are fed back as inputs. This is not apparent from Figure\ref{fig:asynchonous_update_flow}.

The Hopfield network always stabilizes to a fixed point. There is a very
important detail regarding the Hopfield network to achieve this stability. In the
examples thus far, we have not had a problem getting a stable output from the
network, so we have not presented this detail of network operation. This detail
is the need to update the network asynchronously. This means that changes do
not occur simultaneously to outputs that are fed back as inputs, but rather
occur for one vector component at a time.

The true operation of the Hopfield network follows the procedure below for input vector \textbf{Invec} and output vector \textbf{Outvec}:

\begin {itemize}
\item Apply an input, Invec, to the network, and initialize Outvec = Invec
\item Start with i = 1
\item Calculate Value i = DotProduct ( Invec i, Column i of Weight matrix)4. 
\item Calculate Outvec i = f(Value i ) where f is the threshold function discussed previously
\item Update the input to the network with component Outvec i
\item Increment i, and repeat steps 3, 4, 5, and 6 until Invec = Outvec(note that when i reaches its maximum value, it is then next reset to 1 for the cycle to continue)
\end{itemize}

Now let’s see how to apply this procedure. Building on the last example, we
now input E = (1, 0, 0, 1), which is at an equal distance from A and B. Without
applying the asynchronous procedure above, but instead using the shortcut
procedure we’ve been using so far, you would get an output F = (0, 1, 1, 0).
This vector, F, as subsequent input would result in E as the output. This is
incorrect since the network oscillates between two states. We have updated the
entire input vector synchronously.
Now let’s apply asynchronous update. For input E, (1,0,0,1) we arrive at the
following results detailed for each update step, in Table \ref{tab:example_of_asynchronous_update_for_the_hopfield_network}

\section{Classes in C++ Implementation}
In our C++ implementation of this network, there are the following classes: a
\textbf{network class}, and a \textbf{neuron class}. In our implementation, we create the
network with four neurons, and these four neurons are all connected to one
another. A neuron is not self-connected, though. That is, there is no edge in the
directed graph representing the network, where the edge is from one node to
itself. But for simplicity, we could pretend that such a connection exists
carrying a weight of 0, so that the weight matrix has 0’s in its principal
diagonal.

The functions that determine the neuron activations and the network output are
declared public. Therefore they are visible and accessible without restriction.
The activations of the neurons are calculated with functions defined in theneuron class. When there are more than one layer in a neural network, the
outputs of neurons in one layer become the inputs for neurons in the next
layer. In order to facilitate passing the outputs from one layer as inputs to
another layer, our C++ implementations compute the neuron outputs in the
network class. For this reason the threshold function is made a member of the
network class. We do this for the Hopfield network as well. To see if the
network has achieved correct recall, you make comparisons between the
presented pattern and the network output, component by component.

\section{A New Weight Matrix to Recall More Patterns}
Let’s continue to discuss this example. Suppose we are interested in having the
patterns $E = (1, 0, 0, 1)$ and $F = (0, 1, 1, 0)$ also recalled correctly, in addition
to the patterns $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$. In this case we would need to train the network and
come up with a learning algorithm, which we will discuss in more detail later
in the book. We come up with the matrix $W_1$, which follows...
\[ 
W_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
 \matplus0 & -5 &  \matplus4 & \matplus4 \\
-5 &  \matplus0 &  \matplus4 & \matplus4 \\
 \matplus4 &  \matplus4 &  \matplus0 & -5 \\
 \matplus4 &  \matplus4 & -5 &  \matplus0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Try to use this modification of the weight matrix in the source program, and
then compile and run the program to see that the network successfully recalls
all four patterns A, B, E, and F.
