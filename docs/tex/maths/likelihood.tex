\section{Likelihood}
 Probability is used when describing a function of the outcome given a fixed parameter value.
 For example, if a coin is flipped 10 times and it is a fair coin, what is the probability of it landing
 heads-up every time? Likelihood is used when describing a function of a parameter given an outcome.
 For example, if a coin is flipped 10 times and it has landed heads-up 10 times, what is the likelihood
 that the coin is fair?
