LWLR (Locally weighted Linear Regression)
To reduce the mean square error

$$
W(cap) = (X^TWX)^-1X^TWy
$$

$$
w(i,i) = \exp{\frac{x^i - x}{-2k^2}}
$$
x^i -> Test point

Cons: Lot of computation


What if we have more features than data points?
(X^TX)^-1 -> will give an error, so X is not full rank, hence difficult to compute inverse!
