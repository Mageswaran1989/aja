Found the the right thing to tradeoff between Speed vs space vs full support of Java objects?
Default: Java's deafual serialization
Optional: KyroSerializer (https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo)

The KyroSerializer is much faster and generally uses about one tenth of the memory as the default serializer. You can
switch the serializer by setting spark.serializer to spark.KryoSerializer. If you want to use KyroSerializer, you need
to make sure that the classes are serializable by KyroSerializer. Spark provides a trait KryoRegistrator, which you can
extend to register your classes with Kyro, as shown in the following code:

class Reigstrer extends spark.KyroRegistrator {
  override def registerClasses(kyro: Kyro) {
  kyro.register(classOf[MyClass])
  }
}
