Read the following link as it gives general introduction to the topic and introduces you to the
mathematical notations.

\subheading{Jargons}
It would be good if you go through following machine learing terms, before reading further.
- Convex optimization
- Regularization - to control model complexicity
- Loss function - to find the error of the model
- Likelihood

\subsubheading{Summary}
- Feature is value of type T decsribing something in real world eg: height,weight,color,gender etc.,
- Vector is Array[T]() or array of features
- Given set of array of vectors and it's output values(Double), come up with an function that has weights
   which are fitted(i.e searched in a mathematical domain), such that upon giving a new vector input predict its output.
   Or you can rememer like LinearRegression comes with a model class that has weights as its member variable and a method
   called predict which takes the the new vector and returns a values of type T (mostly Double)

\subsubheading{Mathematical Background}
It is always good to know how a algorithms works. In this case the algorithms is not just about using loops and conditions,
we have our most hated friend playing the major role here, MATHS!

\begin{equation}
    f(\wv) := \lambda\, R(\wv) +
    \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n L(\wv;\x_i,y_i)
    \label{eq:regPrimal}
    \ .
\end{equation}
