Create k points for starting centroids (often randomly)
While any point has changed cluster assignment
      for every point in our dataset:
          for every centroid
              calculate the distance between the centroid and point
          assign the point to the cluster with the lowest distance
      for every cluster calculate the mean of the points in that cluster
          assign the centroid to the mean
