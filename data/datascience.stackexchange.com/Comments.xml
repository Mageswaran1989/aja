  <row Id="5591" PostId="5282" Score="0" Text="@Xin , I don't know enough about deep neural networks. But for traditional neural networks, the universal function approximation theorem states that a multilayer network with a single hidden layer can approximate any continuous decision function. I am curious, are there any results proving that DNN have more representational power than regular ANN?" CreationDate="2015-03-05T14:03:04.347" UserId="8517" />

Consider the simple problem of class 1 covering the x-y plane with a triangular region cut out for class 2. There are only two inputs for this network but it requires at least three hidden layer neurons to describe the triangular decision surface. One can easily construct examples that require *many* more hidden layer neurons than inputs (e.g., if class 2 lies in multiple triangular regions)."

  <row Id="5601" PostId="5282" Score="1" Text="@AlexSKinman I deleted my previous comment because the 3-D case I gave was a bad example (that one is indeed linearly separable). I tried training a 4x1 network on the `y = (x1 ∧ x2) ∨ (x3 ∧ x4)` problem numerous times and could not get it to learn the function (the best it would do was accuracy of 0.9375 (i.e., one input was always misclassified). Using a 4x2x1 network, the function was easily learned. If you believe you can construct a separating hyperplane, perhaps you could provide its coefficients (i.e., the `a` coefficients for `f(x) = a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 + a4*x4 - a0`)."
