This spcae will hold all scala examples that Aja comes across, with possible small explanations.
As the build is considered, there is no clear or easy way to integrate with CMake, hence we have to
build it manually and test it!

Download the commons-math library from Go to the download page, http://commons.apache.org/proper/commonsmath/
download_math.cgi

export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/opt/aja/example/scala/ml/commons-math3-3.4.1/commons-math3-3.4.1.jar:/opt/aja/example/scala/ml/jfreechart-1.0.19/jfreechart-1.0.19-demo.jar

Note: All examples are compiled and experimented right in this folder!!!
