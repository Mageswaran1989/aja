Once you pick a framework that allows modelling of your situation, you then see which elements are &quot;fixed&quot; and which are flexible. For example, the model may allow you to define your own network structure (or even learn it) with certain constraints. You have to decide whether this flexibility is sufficient for your purposes. Then within a particular network structure, you can learn parameters given a specific training dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You rarely hard-code behavior in AI/ML solutions. It's all about modelling the underlying situation and accommodating different situations by tweaking elements of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your example, perhaps you might have the robot learn how to detect obstacles (by analyzing elements in the environment), or you might have it keep track of where the obstacles were and which way they were moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="51" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T00:36:31.077" CommentCount="0" />

Generally, though, I'd say you're certainly dealing with big data if the scale is such that it's no longer feasible to manage with more traditional technologies such as RDBMS, at least without complementing them with big data technologies such as Hadoop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How big your data has to actually be for that to be the case is debatable.  Here's a (somewhat provocative) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that claims that it's not really the case for less than 5 TB of data.  (To be clear, it doesn't claim &quot;Less than 5 TB isn't big data&quot;, but just &quot;Less than 5 TB isn't big enough that you need Hadoop&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even on smaller datasets, big data technologies like Hadoop can have other advantages, including being well suited to batch operations, playing well with unstructured data (as well as data whose structure isn't known in advance or could change), horizontal scalability (scaling by adding more nodes instead of beefing up your existing servers), and (as one of the commenters on the above-linked post notes) the ability to integrate your data processing with external data sets (think of a map-reduce where the mapper makes a call to another server).  Other technologies associated with big data, like NoSql databases, emphasize fast performance and consistent availability while dealing with large sets of data, as well also being able to handle semi-unstructured data and to scale horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, traditional RDBMS have their own advantages including ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and better performance for certain operations, as well as being more standardized, more mature, and (for many users) more familiar.  So even for indisputably &quot;big&quot; data, it may make sense to load at least a portion of your data into a traditional SQL database and use that in conjunction with big data technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, a more generous definition would be that you have big data so long as it's big enough that big data technologies provide some added value for you.  But as you can see, that can depend not just on the size of your data but on how you want to work with it and what sort of requirements you have in terms of flexibility, consistency, and performance.  &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; you're using your data is more relevant to the question than what you're using it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. data mining).  That said, uses like data mining and machine learning are more likely to yield useful results if you have a big enough data set to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="14" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T05:44:29.340" CommentCount="0" />

The first part, let us call it &lt;em&gt;soft preprocessing&lt;/em&gt;, could be taken as the usage of different data mining algorithms to preprocess data in such a way that makes it suitable for further analyses. Notice that this could be the analysis itself, in case the goal is simple enough to be tackled in a single shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part, the &lt;em&gt;hard preprocessing&lt;/em&gt;, actually comes prior to any other process, and is may be taken as the usage of simple tools or scripts to clean up data, selecting specific contents to be processed. To this problem, POSIX provides us with a wonderous set of magic tools, which can be used to compose concise -- and very powerful -- preprocessing scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, for people who deal with data coming from social websites (twitter, facebook, ...), the &lt;em&gt;data retrieval&lt;/em&gt; usually yields files with very specific format -- although not always nicely structure, as they may contain missing fields, and so. For these cases, a simple &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; script could clean up the data, producing a &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; input file for later processing. From the magic set, one may also point out &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, and a whole multitude of other tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case simple the source file has too many nitty-gritties, it may also be necessary to produce a bundle of methods to clean up data. In such cases, it is usually better to use scripting languages (other than shell ones), such as Python, Ruby, and Perl. This allows for building up &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt;'s to select specific data in a very straightforward and reusable way. Such &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt;'s are sometimes made public by their writers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;IMDbPY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.stackexchange.com/docs&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange API&lt;/a&gt;, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, answering the question: are there any best practices? It usually depends on your task. If you will always deal with the same data format, it's commonly best to write an &lt;em&gt;organized&lt;/em&gt; script to preprocess it; whereas, if you just need a simple and fast clean up on some dataset, count on POSIX tools for concise shell scripts that will do the whole job &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; faster than a Python script, or so. Since the &lt;em&gt;clean up&lt;/em&gt; depends both on the dataset and on your purposes, it's hard to have everything already done. Yet, there are lots of API's that puts you halfway through with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T16:29:39.927" CommentCount="6" />

Suppose you have a data set which you split in two, test and training.  An overfitted model is one that performs much worse on the test dataset than on training dataset.  It is often observed that models like that also in general perform worse on additional (new) test datasets than models which are not overfitted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way to understand that intuitively is that a model may use some relevant parts of the data (signal) and some irrelevant parts (noise).  An overfitted model uses more of the noise, which increases its performance in the case of known noise (training data) and decreases its performance in the case of novel noise (test data).  The difference in performance between training and test data indicates how much noise the model picks up; and picking up noise directly translates into worse performance on test data (including future data).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary: overfitting is bad by definition, this has not much to do with either complexity or ability to generalize, but rather has to do with mistaking noise for signal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S. On the &quot;ability to generalize&quot; part of the question, it is very possible to have a model which has inherently limited ability to generalize due to the structure of the model (for example linear SVM, ...) but is still prone to overfitting.

The scientists have given you information collected from their work &#xA;with such plants throughout a whole year, and they shall continuously give you information on the future development of their plantation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you run through the data received, and build up a model out of it. Now suppose that, in your model, you considered just as many characteristics as possible to always find out the exact behavior of the plants you saw in the initial dataset. Now, as the production continues, you'll always take into account those characteristics, and will produce very &lt;em&gt;fine-grained&lt;/em&gt; results. However, if the plantation eventually suffer from some seasonal change, the results you will receive may fit your model in such a way that your predictions will begin to fail (either saying that the growth will slow down, while it shall actually speed up, or the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from being unable to detect such small variations, and to usually classify your entries incorrectly, the &lt;em&gt;fine-grain&lt;/em&gt; on the model, i.e., the great amount of variables, may cause the processing to be too costly. Now, imagine that your data is already complex.

Querying, or&#xA;  traversing, the graph involves following paths. Because of the&#xA;  fundamentally path-oriented nature of the datamodel, the majority of&#xA;  path-based graph database operations are highly aligned with the way&#xA;  in which the data is laid out, making them extremely efficient. In&#xA;  their book Neo4j in Action, Partner and Vukotic perform an experiment&#xA;  using a relational store and Neo4j.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The comparison shows that the graph database is substantially quicker&#xA;  for connected data than a relational store.Partner and Vukotic’s&#xA;  experiment seeks to find friends-of-friends in a social network, to a&#xA;  maximum depth of five. Given any two persons chosen at random, is&#xA;  there a path that connects them which is at most five relationships&#xA;  long? For a social network containing 1,000,000 people, each with&#xA;  approximately 50 friends, the results strongly suggest that graph&#xA;  databases are the best choice for connected data, as we see in Table&#xA;  2-1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Table 2-1.

While the Neo4j query runs in two-thirds the time of the relational one, an end-user would barely notice the the difference in milliseconds between the two. By the time we reach depth three (friend-of-friend-of-friend), however, it’s clear that the relational database can no longer deal with the query in a reasonable timeframe: the thirty seconds it takes to complete would be completely unacceptable for an online system. In contrast, Neo4j’s response time remains relatively flat: just a fraction of a second to perform the query—definitely quick enough for an online system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At depth four the relational database exhibits crippling latency,&#xA;  making it practically useless for an online system. Neo4j’s timings&#xA;  have deteriorated a little too, but the latency here is at the&#xA;  periphery of being acceptable for a responsive online system. Finally,&#xA;  at depth five, the relational database simply takes too long to&#xA;  complete the query. Neo4j, in contrast, returns a result in around two&#xA;  seconds. At depth five, it transpires almost the entire network is our&#xA;  friend: for many real-world use cases, we’d likely trim the results,&#xA;  and the timings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions are:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is this a reasonable test to emulate what one might except to find in a social network? &lt;em&gt;(Meaning do real social networks normally have nodes with approximately 50 friends for example; seems like the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_rich_get_richer_%28statistics%29&quot;&gt;rich get richer&lt;/a&gt;&quot; model would be more natural for social networks, though might be wrong.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Regardless of the naturalness of the emulation, is there any reason to believe the results are off, or unreproducible? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="158" LastEditorUserId="118" LastEditDate="2014-05-15T13:15:02.727" LastActivityDate="2014-05-15T13:15:02.727" Title="Is this Neo4j comparison to RDBMS execution time correct?"

As Christopher said, magnitude of effect a way to treat this.  Combining these two ideas, you might use a confidence interval around your magnitude of effect, and apply a false discovery rate correction to the p-value of the confidence interval.  The effects for which even the lowest bound of the corrected confidence interval is high are likely to be strong effects, regardless of huge data set size.  I am not aware of any published paper that combines confidence intervals with false discovery rate correction in this way, but it seems like a straightforward and intuitively understandable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make this even better, use a non-parametric way to estimate confidence intervals.  Assuming a distribution is likely to give very optimistic estimates here, and even fitting a distribution to the data is likely to be inaccurate.  Since the information about the shape of the distribution past the edges of the confidence interval comes from a relatively small subsample of the data, this is where it really pays to be careful.

But here are important things to take into account, and that make it &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; to have such low latency on queries from all these TBs of data in different machines:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;distributed computing: by being distributed does not mean that the indexes are simply distributed in different machines, they are actually replicated along different clusters, which allows for lots of users performing different queries with low retrieval time (yes, huge companies can afford for that much of machines);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;caching: caches tremendously reduce execution time, be it for the crawling step, for the retrieval of pages, or for the ranking and exihibition of results;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;lots of tweaking: all the above and very efficient algorithms/solutions can only be effective if the implementation is also efficient. There are tons of (hard coded) optimizations, such as locality of reference, compression, caching; all of them usually appliable to different parts of the processing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering that, lets try to address your questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;but I imagine it infeasible for the results of every single possible query to be indexed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it would be, and actually is infeasible to have results for &lt;em&gt;every single possible query&lt;/em&gt;. There is an infinite number of terms in the world (even if you assume that only terms properly spelled will be entered), and there is an exponential number of queries from these &lt;code&gt;n -&amp;gt; inf&lt;/code&gt; terms (&lt;code&gt;2^n&lt;/code&gt;). So what is done? Caching. But if there are so many queries/results, which ones to cache? Caching policies. The most frequent/popular/relevant-for-the-user queries are the ones cached.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;wouldn't the hardware latency in Google's hardware be huge? Even if the data in Google were all stored in TB/s SSDs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nowdays, with such highly developed processors, people tend to think that every possible task that must finish within a second (or less), and that deals with so much data, must be processed by extremely powerful processors with multiple cores and lots of memory. However, the one thing &lt;em&gt;ruling&lt;/em&gt; market is money, and the investors are not interested in wasting it. So what is done?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The preference is actually for having lots of machines, each using simple/accessible (in terms of cost) processors, which lowers the price of building up the multitude of clusters there are. And yes, it does work. The main bottleneck always boils down to disk, if you consider simple measurements of &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uf6al.gif&quot;&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt;. But once there are so many machines, one can afford to load things up to main memory, instead of working on hard disks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Memory cards are &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; for us, mere human beings, but they are very cheap for enterprises that buy lots of such cards at once. Since it's not costly, having much memory as needed to load indexes and keep caches at hand is not a problem. And since there are so many machines, there is no need for super fast processors, as you can direct queries to different places, and have clusters of machines responsible for attending &lt;em&gt;specific geographical regions&lt;/em&gt;, which allows for more &lt;em&gt;specialized&lt;/em&gt; data caching, and even better response times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Does MapReduce help solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I don't think that using or not MapReduce is restricted information inside Google, I'm not conversant about this point. However, Google's implementation of MapReduce (which is surely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Hadoop) must have lots of optimizations, many involving the aspects discussed above. So, the architecture of MapReduce probably helps guiding how the computations are physically distributed, but there are many other points to be considered to justify such speed in querying time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Okay, so I understand that popular searches can be cached in memory. But what about unpopular searches?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The graph below presents a curve of how the &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of queries occur. You can see that there are three main kinds of searches, each of them holding approximately 1/3 of the volume of queries (area below curve). The plot shows power law, and reinforces the fact that smaller queries are the most popular. The second third of queries are still feasible to process, since they hold few words. But the set of so-called &lt;em&gt;obscure queries&lt;/em&gt;, which usually consist of non-experienced users' queries, are not a negligible part of the queries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CpcNf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heavy-tailed distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there lies space for novel solutions. Since it's not just one or two queries (but one third of them), they must have &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; results. If you type in something &lt;em&gt;much too obscure&lt;/em&gt; in a Google search, it shan't take longer to return a list of results, but will most probably show you something it &lt;em&gt;inferred&lt;/em&gt; you'd like to say. Or it may simply state that there was no document with such terms -- or even cut down your search to 32 words (which just happened to me in a random test here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of appliable heuristics, which may be either to ignore some words, or to try to break the query into smaller ones, and gather the most &lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt; results. And all these solutions can be tailored and tweaked to respect &lt;em&gt;feasible waiting times&lt;/em&gt; of, say, less then a second? :D&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastEditorUserId="84" LastEditDate="2014-05-16T04:33:52.310" LastActivityDate="2014-05-16T04:33:52.310" CommentCount="2" />

Orient is a Graph-Document database server written entirely in Java. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In graph databases, relationships are considered first class citizens and therefore traversing those relationships can be done pretty quickly. Orient is also a document database which would allow you the kind of schema-free architecture it sounds like you would need. The real reason I suggest Orient, however, is because of its extensiblity. It supports streaming via sockets, and the entire database can be embedded into another application. Finally, it can be scaled efficiently and/or can work entirely through memory. So, with some Java expertise, you can actually run your preset queries against the database in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are doing something similar. In creating an app/site for social science research collaboration, we found ourselves with immensely complex data models. We ended up writing several of the queries using the Gremlin Traversal Language (a subset of Groovy, which is, of course, Java at its heart), and then exposing those queries through the binary connection server of the OrientDB. So, the client opens a TCP socket, sends a short binary message, and the query is executing in Java directly against the in-memory database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OrientDB also supports writing function queries in Javascript, and you can use Node.js to interact directly with an Orient instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For something of this size, I would want to use Orient in conjunction with Hadoop or something like that. You can also use Orient in conjunction with esper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider:&#xA;An introduction to orient: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/&quot;&gt;http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Complex, real-time queries: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/&quot;&gt;http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A discussion about streaming options with java and orient: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227&quot;&gt;https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastActivityDate="2014-05-17T04:18:10.020" CommentCount="1" />

For example, DBSCAN uses epsilon-neighborhoods around a point; there is nothing in there that specifically says the triangle inequality matters.  So you can probably use DBSCAN, although you may have to do some kind of nonstandard spatial index to do efficient lookups in your case.  Your version of epsilon-neighborhood will likely be sim &gt; 1/epsilon rather than the other way around.  Same story with k-means and related algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you construct a metric from your similarity?  One possibility: dist(ei, ej) = min( sim(ei, ek) + sim(ek, ej) ) for all k ...  Alternately, can you provide an upper  bound such that sim(ei, ej) &amp;lt; sim(ei, ek) + sim(ek, ej) + d, for all k and some positive constant d?  Intuitively, large sim values means closer together: is 1/sim metric-like?  What about 1/(sim + constant)?  What about min( 1/sim(ei, ek) + 1/sim(ek, ej) ) for all k? (that last is guaranteed to be a metric, btw)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternate construction of a metric is to do an embedding.  As a first step, you can try to map your points ei -&gt; xi, such that xi minimize sum( abs( sim(ei, ej) - f( dist(xi, xj) ) ), for some suitable function f and metric dist.  The function f converts distance in the embedding to a similarity-like value; you'd have to experiment a bit, but 1/dist or exp^-dist are good starting points.  You'd also have to experiment on the best dimension for xi.  From there, you can use conventional clustering on xi.  The idea here is that you can almost (in a best fit sense) convert your distances in the embedding to similarity values, so they would cluster correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the use of predefined parameters, all algorithms have some tuning.  DBSCAN can find the number of clusters, but you still need to give it some parameters.  In general, tuning requires multiple runs of the algorithm with different values for the tunable parameters, together with some function that evaluates goodness-of-clustering (either calculated separately, provided by the clustering algorithm itself, or just eyeballed :)  If the character of your data doesn't change, you can tune once and then use those fixed parameters; if it changes then you have to tune for each run.  You can find that out by tuning for each run and then comparing how well the parameters from one run work on another, compared to the parameters specifically tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2014-05-18T09:17:15.557" LastActivityDate="2014-05-18T09:17:15.557" CommentCount="0" />

Further, distributed computing is very appealing for BigData processing, as it allows for exploiting disk parallelism (usually the bottleneck for large databases).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the level of parallelism, it may be taken rather as a constraint on the synchronization.

Such is the restraint that, in case of divergent branches, it is necessary to discard lots of unnecessary computations, until the threads reconverge. For CPU threads, though, they commonly diverge; yet, one may use synchronization structures to grant concurrent execution of specific sections of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastActivityDate="2014-05-18T17:38:01.383" CommentCount="0" />

For example, although clustering users may depend on different use cases and selection of features, but having a base clustering of Twitter/Facebook users can be useful in many Big Data applications, which is neither provided by the API, nor available publicly in independent data sets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there any index or publicly available data set hosting site containing valuable data sets that can be reused in solving other Big Data problems? I mean something like GitHub (or a group of sites/public data sets or at least a comprehensive listing) for the data science.

Lucene has a pretty old but effective model, it uses inverted trees to find and retrieve documents. Without further details, all documents are split in tokens (terms), and for each term is maintained a data structure, which stores all the documents which contains the given term.

The implementation of the hash table is not important, it could be a standard chained implementation or more advanced open hash addressing scheme.

We can denote the parameters of the Dirichlet as a vector of size K of the form ~ 1/B(a) * Product(x_i ^ (a_i-1)), where a is the vector of size K of the parameters, and sum of x_i = 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the LDA uses some constructs like:&#xA;- a document can have multiple topics (because of this multiplicity, we need the Dirichlet distribution); and there is a Dirichlet distribution which models this relation&#xA;- words can also belong to multiple topics, when you consider them outside of a document; so here we need another Dirichlet to model this&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The previous two are distributions which you do not really see from data, this is why is called latent, or hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in Bayesian inference you use the Bayes rule to infer the posterior probability. For simplicity, let's say you have data &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and you have a model for this data governed by some parameters theta. In order to infer values for this parameters, in full Bayesian inference you will infer the posterior probability of these parameters using Bayes' rule with &lt;em&gt;p(theta|x) = p(x|theta)p(theta|alpha)/p(x|alpha)&lt;/em&gt;. In plain words is &lt;em&gt;posterior probability = likelihood x prior probability / marginal likelihood&lt;/em&gt;. Note that here comes an &lt;em&gt;alpha&lt;/em&gt;. This is your initial belief about this distribution, and is the parameter of the prior distribution. Usually this is chosen in such a way that will have a conjugate prior (so the distribution of the posterior is the same with the distribution of the prior) and often to encode some knowledge if you have one or to have maximum entropy if you know nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The parameters of the prior are called &lt;em&gt;hyperparameters&lt;/em&gt;. So, in LDA, both topic distributions, over documents and over words have also correspondent priors, which are denoted usually with alpha and beta, and because are the parameters of the prior distributions are called hyperparameters. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now about choosing priors. If you plot some Dirichlet distributions you will note that if the individual parameters &lt;em&gt;alpha_k&lt;/em&gt; have the same value, the pdf is symmetric in the simplex defined by the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; values, which is the minimum or maximum for pdf is at the center. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all the alpha_k have values lower than unit the maximum is found at corners&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5khZE.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or can if all values alpha_k are the same and greater than 1 the maximum will be found in center like &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/prmlfigs-png/Figure2.5c.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that if values for alpha_k are not equal the symmetry is broken and the maximum will be found near bigger values. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional, please note that values for priors parameters produce smooth pdfs of the distribution as the values of the parameters are near 1. So if you have great confidence that something is clearly distributed in a way you know, with a high degree of confidence, than values far from 1 in absolute value are to be used, if you do not have such kind of knowledge than values near 1 would be encode this lack of knowledge. It is easy to see why 1 plays such a role in Dirichlet distribution from the formula of the distribution itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way to understand this is to see that prior encode prior-knowledge. In the same time you might think that prior encode some prior seen data. This data was not saw by the algorithm itself, it was saw by you, you learned something, and you can model prior according to what you know (learned). So in the prior parameters (hyperparameters) you encode also how big this data set you apriori saw, because the sum of alpha_k can be that also as the size of this more or less imaginary data set. So the bigger the prior data set, the bigger is the confidence, the bigger the values of alpha_k you can choose, the sharper the surface near maximum value, which means also less doubts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope it helped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS: It's a hell to write something without LaTeX notation.

The default pricing more or less means that the same amount of resource costs about the same regardless of the instance type, that can vary a lot; large instances can be cheaper than small ones, or N small instances can be much cheaper than one large machine with equivalent resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One massive consideration here is that the computation paradigm can change quite a lot when you move from one machine to multiple machines. The tradeoffs that the communication overhead induce may force you to, for example, adopt a data-parallel paradigm to scale. That means a different choice of tools and algorithm. For example, SGD looks quite different in-memory and in Python than on MapReduce. So you would have to consider this before parallelizing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may choose to distribute work across a cluster, even if a single node and non-distributed paradigms work for you, for reliability. If a single node fails, you lose all of the computation; a distributed computation can potentially recover and complete just the part of the computation that was lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="21" LastActivityDate="2014-05-24T10:36:58.987" CommentCount="0" />

Problems which run significantly slower on N quadruple c3 than on 2N double c3 are rare (an artificial example may be running multiple simple filters on a large number of images, where you go through all images for each filter rather than all filters for the same image).

MapReduce allows you to operate over huge amounts of data- with a lot of work put in to prevent failure due to hardware. MapReduce is a poor choice for computing results on the fly because it is slow. (A typical MapReduce job takes on the order of minutes or hours, not microseconds)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A MapReduce job takes a file (or some data store) as an input and writes a file of results. If you want these results available to an application, it is your responsibility to put this data in a place that is accessible. This is likely slow, and there will be a lag between the values you can display, and the values that represent your system in its current state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important distinction to make when considering using MapReduce in building realtime systems is that of training your model, and applying your model. If you think your model parameters do not change quickly, you can fit them with MapReduce, and then have a mechanism for accessing these pre-fit parameters when you want to apply your model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storm&lt;/strong&gt;: A real-time, streaming computational system. Storm is online framework, meaning, in this sense, a service that interacts with a running application. In contrast to MapReduce, it receives small pieces of data (not a whole file) as they are processed in your application. You define a DAG of operations to perform on the data. A common and simple use case for Storm is tracking counters, and using that information to populate a real-time dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storm doesn't have anything (necessarily) to do with persisting your data. Here, streaming is another way to say keeping the information you care about and throwing the rest away. In reality, you probably have a persistence layer in your application that has already recorded the data, and so this a good and justified separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to know more...&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;If you would like to learn more about real-time systems that that fit parameters with MR and apply the models a different way &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/hbasecon-2013-24063525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here are slides for a talk I gave on building real-time recommendation engines on HBase.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An excellent paper that marries real-time counting and persistence in an interesting way is &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242610&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google News Personalization: Scalable Online Collaborative Filtering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting marriage of MR and Storm is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twitter/summingbird/wiki&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SummingBird&lt;/a&gt;.

In fact, most frameworks have some sort of core infrastructure around which a core layer of basic functionality is implemented.  More specific functionality makes use of the basic layer and is placed in a second layer around the core.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now by shortcuts I mean going straight from a second layer routine to another second layer routine without using the core.  Typical example (from my domain) would be timestamps: You have a timestamped data source of some kind.  Thus far the job is simply to read the data off the wire and pass it to the core so your other code can feast on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now your industry changes the default timestamp format for a very good reason (in my case they went from unix time to GPS time).  Unless your framework is industry-specific it is very unlikely that they're willing to change the core representation of time, so you end up using a framework that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; does what you want.  Every time you access your data you have to convert it to industry-time-format first, and every time you want it modified you have to convert it back to whatever the core deems appropriate.  There is no way that you can hand over data straight from the source to a sink without double conversion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where your hand-crafted frameworks will shine, it's just a minor change and you're back modelling the real world whereas all other (non-industry-specific) frameworks will now have a performance disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the discrepancy between the real world and the model will add up.

But if, for some reason, you can't change the framework, i.e. you do have to put up with double conversion of data to go from one end to another, then you'd typically employ something that minimises the additional overhead.

When you repeat classification tests you will end up having multiple confusion matrices. The question is how to get a meaningful aggregate confusion matrix. The answer depends on what is the meaning of meaningful (pun intended). I think there is not a single version of meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way is to follow the rough idea of multiple testing. In general, you test something multiple times in order to get more accurate results. As a general principle one can reason that averaging on the results of the multiple tests reduces the variance of the estimates, so as a consequence, it increases the precision of the estimates. You can proceed in this way, of course, by summing position by position and then dividing by the number of tests. You can go further and instead of estimating only a value for each cell of the confusion matrix, you can also compute some confidence intervals, t-values and so on. This is OK from my point of view. But it tell only one side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other side of the story which might be investigated is how stable are the results for the same instances. To exemplify that I will take an extreme example. Suppose you have a classification model for 3 classes. Suppose that these classes are in the same proportion. If your model is able to predict one class perfectly and the other 2 classes with random like performance, you will end up having 0.33 + 0.166 + 0.166 = 0.66 misclassification ratio. This might seem good, but even if you take a look on a single confusion matrix you will not know that your performance on the last 2 classes varies wildly. Multiple tests can help. But averaging the confusion matrices would reveal this? My belief is not. The averaging will give the same result more or less, and doing multiple tests will only decrease the variance of the estimation. However it says nothing about the wild instability of prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So another way to do compose the confusion matrices would better involve a prediction density for each instance. One can build this density by counting for each instance, the number of times it was predicted a given class. After normalization, you will have for each instance a prediction density rather a single prediction label. You can see that a single prediction label is similar with a degenerated density where you have probability of 1 for the predicted class and 0 for the other classes for each separate instance. Now having this densities one can build a confusion matrix by adding the probabilities from each instance and predicted class to the corresponding cell of the aggregated confusion matrix. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can argue that this would give similar results like the previous method. However I think that this might be the case sometimes, often when the model has low variance, the second method is less affected by how the samples from the tests are drawn, and thus more stable and closer to the reality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also the second method might be altered in order to obtain a third method, where one can assign as prediction the label with highest density from the prediction of a given instance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not implemented those things but I plan to study further because I believe might worth spending some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastEditorUserId="108" LastEditDate="2014-06-11T09:39:34.373" LastActivityDate="2014-06-11T09:39:34.373" CommentCount="3" />

The main advantage of the database is the ability to work with data much larger than memory, to have random or indexed access, and to add/append/modify data quickly.  The main *dis*advantage is that it is much slower than HDF, for problems in which the entire dataset needs to be read in and processed.  Another disadvantage is that, with the exception of embedded-style databases like SQLite, a database is a system (requiring admnistration, setup, maintenance, etc) rather than a simple self-contained data store.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text file format options are XML/JSON/CSV.  They are cross-platform/language/toolkit, and are a good archival format due to the ability to be self-describing (or obvious :).  If uncompressed, they are huge (10x-100x HDF), but if compressed, they can be fairly space-efficient (compressed XML is about the same as HDF).  The main disadvantage here is again speed: parsing text is much, much slower than HDF.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other binary formats (npy/npz numpy files, blz blaze files, protocol buffers, Avro, ...) have very similar properties to HDF, except they are less widely supported (may be limited to just one platform: numpy) and may have specific other limitations.  They typically do not offer a compelling advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HDF is a good complement to databases, it may make sense to run a query to produce a roughly memory-sized dataset and then cache it in HDF if the same data would be used more than once.  If you have a dataset which is fixed, and usually processed as a whole, storing it as a collection of appropriately sized HDF files is not a bad option.  If you have a dataset which is updated often, staging some of it as HDF files periodically might still be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, HDF is a good format for data which is read (or written) typically as a whole; it is the lingua franca or common/preferred interchange format for many applications due to wide support and compatibility, decent as an archival format, and very fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S. To give this some practical context, my most recent experience comparing HDF to alternatives, a certain small (much less than memory-sized) dataset took 2 seconds to read as HDF (and most of this is probably overhead from Pandas); ~1 minute to read from JSON; and 1 &lt;em&gt;hour&lt;/em&gt; to write to database.  Certainly the database write could be sped up, but you'd better have a good DBA!

Teams within the firm’s asset management group are&#xA;  performing ad hoc analysis on daily feeds of price, position, and order information. Having&#xA;  ad hoc analysis to all of the detailed data allows the group to detect anomalies across&#xA;  certain asset classes and identify suspicious behavior. Users previously relied solely on&#xA;  desktop spreadsheet tools. Now, with Datameer and Cloudera, users have a powerful&#xA;  platform that allows them to sift through more data more quickly and avert potential&#xA;  losses before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A leading retail bank is using Cloudera and Datameer to validate data accuracy and quality&#xA;  as required by the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations. Integrating loan and branch data&#xA;  as well as wealth management data, the bank’s data quality initiative is responsible for&#xA;  ensuring that every record is accurate. The process includes subjectingthe data to over&#xA;  50 data sanity and quality checks. The results of those checks are trended over time to&#xA;  ensure that the tolerances for data corruption and data domains aren’t changing adversely&#xA;  and that the risk profiles being reported to investors and regulatory agencies are prudent&#xA;  and in compliance with regulatory requirements. The results are reported through a data&#xA;  quality dashboard to the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who are ultimately&#xA;  responsible for ensuring the accuracy of regulatory compliance reporting as well as&#xA;  earnings forecasts to investors&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't see any other finance related studies at Cloudera, but I didn't search very hard.

Perhaps most importantly, you can't run any type of custom functions on Redshift. In Hadoop you can, using many languages (Java, Python, Ruby.. you name it). For example, NLP in Hadoop is easy, while it's more or less impossible in Redshift. I.e. there are lots of things you can do in Hadoop but not on Redshift. This is probably the most important difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Performance Profile&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Query execution on Redshift is in most cases significantly more efficient than on Hadoop. However, this efficiency comes from the indexing that is done when the data is loaded into Redshift (I'm using the term &lt;code&gt;indexing&lt;/code&gt; very loose here). Therefore, it's great if you load your data once and execute multiple queries, but if you want to execute only one query for example, you might actually lose out in performance overall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Cost Profile&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Which solution wins out in cost depends on the situation (like performance), but you probably need quite a lot of queries in order to make it cheaper than Hadoop (more specifically Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce). For example, if you are doing OLAP, it's very likely that Redshift comes out cheaper. If you do daily batch ETLs, Hadoop is more likely to come out cheaper.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, we've replaced part of our ETL that was done in Hive to Redshift, and it was a pretty great experience; mostly for the ease of development. Redshift's Query Engine is based on PostgreSQL and is very mature, compared to Hive's. Its ACID characteristics make it easier to reason about it, and the quicker response time allows more testing to be done. It's a great tool to have, but it won't replace Hadoop.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  As for setup complexity, I'd even say it's easier with Hadoop if you use AWS's EMR. Their tools are so mature that it's ridiculously easy to have your Hadoop job running. Tools and mechanisms surrounding Redshift's operation aren't that mature yet. For example, Redshift can't handle trickle loading and thus you have to come up with something that turns that into a batched load, which can add some complexity to your ETL. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="638" LastEditorUserId="638" LastEditDate="2014-06-11T09:07:33.570" LastActivityDate="2014-06-11T09:07:33.570" CommentCount="2" />

All languages were designed to make some type of constructs more easy to build than others. And the knowledge and mastery of a programming language is more important and effective than the features of that language compared to others.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see there are two dimensions of this question. The first dimension is the ability to explore, build proof of concepts or models at a fast pace, eventually having at hand enough tools to study what is going on (like statistical tests, graphics, measurement tools, etc). This kind of activity is usually preferred by researchers and data scientists (I always wonder what that means, but I use this term for its loose definition). They tend to rely on well-known and verified instruments, which can be used for proofs or arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second dimension is the ability to extend, change, improve or even create tools, algorithms or models. In order to achieve that you need a proper programming language. Roughly all of them are the same. If you work for a company, than you depend a lot on the company's infrastructure, internal culture and your choices diminish significantly. Also, when you want to implement an algorithm for production use, you have to trust the implementation. And implementing in another language which you do not master will not help you much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to favor for the first type of activity the R ecosystem. You have a great community, a huge set of tools, proofs that these tools works as expected. Also, you can consider Python, Octave (to name a few), which are reliable candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the second task, you have to think before at what you really want. If you want robust production ready tools, then C/C++, Java, C# are great candidates. I consider Python as a second citizen in this category, together with Scala and friends. I do not want to start a flame war, it's my opinion only. But after more than 17 years as a developer, I tend to prefer a strict contract and my knowledge, than the freedom to do whatever you might think of (like it happens with a lot of dynamic languages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I want to learn as much as possible. I decided that I have to choose the hard way, which means to implement myself everything from scratch. I use R as a model and inspiration. It has great treasures in libraries and a lot of experience distilled. However, as a programming language R, for me at least is a nightmare. So I decided to use Java, and use no additional library. That is only because of my experience, and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have time, the best thing you can do is to spend some time with all these things. In this way you will earn for yourself the best answer possible, fitted for you. Dijkstra said once that the tools influence the way you think, so it is advisable to know your tools before letting them to model how you think. You can read more about that in his famous paper called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Humble Programmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastEditorUserId="733" LastEditDate="2014-06-12T11:16:51.183" LastActivityDate="2014-06-12T11:16:51.183" CommentCount="0" />

To give you an example, suppose you have a binary classification model, with classes c1 and c2. For a given instance, your classifier would have to return a score for c1 and another for c2. If this score is a probability-like (preferrable), than something like p(c1), p(c2) would work. In plain English is translated like &quot;I (the model) classify this instance as c1 with probability p(c1), and as c2 with probability  p(c2)=1-p(c1)&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This applies for all type of classifiers, not only for decision trees. Having these scores you can than compute ROC or AUC by varying a threshold on p(c1) values, from the smallest to the greatest value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have an implementation of a decision tree and you want to change that implementation to return scores instead of labels you have to compute those values. The most used way for decision trees is to use the proportion of classes from the leaf nodes. So, for example you have built a decision tree and when you predict the class for an instance you arrive at a leaf node which have (stored from the learning phase) 10 instances of class c1 and 15 instances of class c2, you can use the ratios as the scores. So, in our example, you would return p(c1) = 10 / (10+15) = 0.4 probability of class c1 and p(c2) = 15/(10+15)=0.6 probability of being class c2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For further reading on the ROC curves, the best and inspiring source of information I found to be the Tom Fawcett paper called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;amp;url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/ROCintro.pdf&amp;amp;ei=DYCZU96QGPOV7AaAx4CgBA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNECLoecin6ieT-0ymLQ--FoMjkMZw&amp;amp;sig2=3bGE2y1N3I2Re_YWn0EDFA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;An Introduction to ROC Analysis&lt;/a&gt;, it's solid gold on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2014-06-12T10:27:14.480" CommentCount="0" />

Model Building and Prediction phase. Typically, model building is performed as a batch process and &lt;strong&gt;predictions are done realtime&lt;/strong&gt;. The model building process is a compute intensive process while the prediction happens in a jiffy. Therefore, performance of an algorithm in Python or R doesn't really affect the turn-around time of the user. Python 1, R 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production:&lt;/strong&gt; The real difference between Python and R comes in being production ready. Python, as such is a full fledged programming language and many organisations use it in their production systems. R is a statistical programming software favoured by many academia and due to the rise in data science and availability of libraries and being open source, the industry has started using R. Many of these organisations have their production systems either in Java, C++, C#, Python etc. So, ideally they would like to have the &lt;strong&gt;prediction system&lt;/strong&gt; in the same language to reduce the latency and maintenance issues.&#xA;Python 2, R 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the languages have enormous and reliable libraries. R has over 5000 libraries catering to many domains while Python has some incredible packages like &lt;strong&gt;Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib&lt;/strong&gt;. Python 3, R 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the language are interpreted languages. Many say that python has a good learning curve, it's almost like reading english (to put it on a lighter note) but R has a reputation of having a steeper learning curve. Also, both of them have good IDEs (Spyder etc for Python and RStudio for R). Python 4, R 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; R software initially had problems with large computations (say, like nxn matrix multiplications). But, this issue is addressed with the introduction of R by Revolution Analytics. They have re-written computation intensive operations in C which is blazingly fast. Python being a high level language is relatively slow. Python 4, R 3.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt; In data science, we frequently tend to plot data to showcase patterns to users. Therefore, visualisations become an important criteria in choosing a software and R completely kills Python in this regard. Thanks to Hadley Wickham for an incredible ggplot2 package. R wins hands down. Python 4, R 4.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with Big Data:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the constraints of R is it stores the data in system memory (RAM). So, RAM capacity becomes a constraint when you are handling Big Data. Python does well, but I would say, as both R and Python have HDFS connectors, leveraging Hadoop infrastructure would give substantial performance improvement. So, Python 5, R 5.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, both the languages are equally good. Therefore, depending upon your domain and the place you work, you have got to smartly choose the right language. Technology world usually prefers single language. Business users (marketing analytics, retail analytics) usually go with statistical programming language R since they frequently do quick prototyping and build visualisations which is faster do in R.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="514" LastActivityDate="2014-06-12T12:59:00.663" CommentCount="5" />

Naturally you are trying to build a model that predicts how if a person defaults on their loan.  Lets keep this simple and say that the outcomes are either full payment, or default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a business perspective you can sum up a models performance with a contingency matrix:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RgWr9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the model predicts someone is going to default, do they?  To determining the downsides of over and under fitting I find it helpful to think of it as an optimization problem, because in each cross section of predicted verses actual model performance there is either a cost or profit to be made:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/78kH2.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example predicting a default that is a default means avoiding any risk, and predicted a non-default which doesn't default will make $50 per loan issued.  Where things get dicey is when you are wrong, if you default when you predicted non-default you lose the entire loan principal and if you predict default when a customer actually would not have you suffer $50 of missed opportunity.  The numbers here are not important, just the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this framework we can now begin to understand the difficulties associated with over and under fitting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over fitting in this case would mean that your model works far better on you development/test data then it does in production.  Or to put it another way, your model in production will far underperform what you saw in development, this false confidence will probably cause you to take on far more risky loans then you otherwise would and leaves you very vulnerable to losing money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, under fitting in this context will leave you with a model that just does a poor job of matching reality.  While the results of this can be wildly unpredictable, (the opposite word you want to describe your predictive models), commonly what happens is standards are tightened up to compensate for this, leading to less overall customers leading to lost good customers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under fitting suffers a kind of opposite difficulty that over fitting does, which is under fitting gives you lower confidence.  Insidiously, the lack of predictability still leads you to take on unexpected risk, all of which is bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience the best way to avoid both of these situations is validating your model on data that is completely outside the scope of your training data, so you can have some confidence that you have a representative sample of what you will see &quot;in the wild&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is always a good practice to revalidate your models periodically, to determine how quickly your model is degrading, and if it is still accomplishing your objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to some things up, your model is under fitted when it does a poor job of predicting both the development and production data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="780" LastActivityDate="2014-06-13T20:13:01.913" CommentCount="0" />

You can do this down the line, but keeping your stack as simple as possible is a good move, especially early on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking something bigger than you:&lt;/strong&gt; You never want to be pushing up against the barriers of the language you want to use. This is a huge issue when it comes to languages like &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FORTRAN&lt;/code&gt;, which simply don't offer the full functionality of languages like &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick Community&lt;/strong&gt;: The one most difficult thing to find in any language is community. &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; is the clear winner here. If you get stuck, you ask something on SO, and someone will answer in a matter of minutes, which is simply not the case for most other languages. If you're learning something in a vacuum you will simply learn much slower.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the minus points, I might actually push back on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deepening your knowledge of one language is a decent idea, but knowing &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one language, without having practice generalizing that knowledge to other languages is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot. I have changed my entire favored development stack three time over as many years, moving from &lt;code&gt;MATLAB&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Java&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;haskell&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. Learning to transfer your knowledge to another language is far more valuable than just knowing one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as feasibility, this is something you're going to see again and again in any programming career. Turing completeness means you could technically do everything with &lt;code&gt;HTML4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CSS3&lt;/code&gt;, but you want to pick the right tool for the job. If you see the ideal tool and decide to leave it by the roadside you're going to find yourself slowed down wishing you had some of the tools you left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great example of that last point is trying to deploy &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code. 'R''s networking capabilities are hugely lacking compared to &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, and if you want to deploy a service, or use slightly off-the-beaten path packages, the fact that &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; has an order of magnitude more packages than &lt;code&gt;CRAN&lt;/code&gt; is a huge help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="548" LastActivityDate="2014-06-16T15:00:04.577" CommentCount="6" />

Our usual approach here is to withhold data entirely, or in some cases to reduce its resolution; e.g., replacing an exact street address with the corresponding county or census tract. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that certain types of analysis and processing must be done in-house, even when a third party has resources and expertise more suited to the task. Since the source data is not disclosed, the way we go about this analysis and processing lacks transparency. As a result, any third party's ability to perform QA/QC, adjust parameters or make refinements may be very limited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Anonymizing Confidential Data&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One task involves identifying individuals by their names, in user-submitted data, while taking into account errors and inconsistencies. A private individual might be recorded in one place as &quot;Dave&quot; and in another as &quot;David,&quot; commercial entities can have many different abbreviations, and there are always some typos. I've developed scripts based on a number of criteria that determine when two records with non-identical names represent the same individual, and assign them a common ID. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point we can make the dataset anonymous by withholding the names and replacing them with this personal ID number. But this means the recipient has almost no information about e.g. the strength of the match. We would prefer to be able to pass along as much information as possible without divulging identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What Doesn't Work&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, it would be great to be able to encrypt strings while preserving edit distance. This way, third parties could do some of their own QA/QC, or choose to do further processing on their own, without ever accessing (or being able to potentially reverse-engineer) PII. Perhaps we match strings in-house with edit distance &amp;lt;= 2, and the recipient wants to look at the implications of tightening that tolerance to edit distance &amp;lt;= 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the only method I am familiar with that does this is ROT13, which hardly even counts as encryption; it's like writing the names upside down and saying, &quot;promise you won't flip the paper over?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; solution would be to abbreviate everything. &quot;Ellen Roberts&quot; becomes &quot;ER&quot; and so forth. This is a poor solution because in some cases the initials, in association with public data, will reveal a person's identity, and in other cases it's too ambiguous; &quot;Benjamin Othello Ames&quot; and &quot;Bank of America&quot; will have the same initials, but their names are otherwise dissimilar. So it doesn't do either of the things we want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An inelegant alternative is to introduce additional fields to track certain attributes of the name, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| Row | ID | Name              | WordChars | Origin |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 1   | 17 | &quot;AMELIA BEDELIA&quot;  | (6, 7)    | Eng    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 2   | 18 | &quot;CHRISTOPH BAUER&quot; | (9, 5)    | Ger    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 3   | 18 | &quot;C J BAUER&quot;       | (1, 1, 5) | Ger    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 4   | 19 | &quot;FRANZ HELLER&quot;    | (5, 6)    | Ger    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I call this &quot;inelegant&quot; because it requires anticipating which qualities might be interesting and it's relatively coarse. If the names are removed, there's not much you can reasonably conclude about the strength of the match between rows 2 &amp;amp; 3, or about the distance between rows 2 &amp;amp; 4 (i.e., how close they are to matching).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to transform strings in such a way that as many useful qualities of the original string are preserved as possible while obscuring the original string.

In no particular order they are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;: Basically boils down to how quickly the language does matrix multiplication, as that is more or less the most important task in data science.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;: At least for me personally, this comes down to ease of building a distributed system.

The protocol is based on Bloom filters on q-grams of identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article goes into detail about the method, which I will summarize here to the best of my ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Bloom filter is a fixed-length series of bits storing the results of a fixed set of independent hash functions, each computed on the same input value. The output of each hash function should be an index value from among the possible indexes in the filter; i.e., if you have a 0-indexed series of 10 bits, hash functions should return (or be mapped to) values from 0 to 9. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The filter starts with each bit set to 0. After hashing the input value with each function from the set of hash functions, each bit corresponding to an index value returned by any hash function is set to 1. If the same index is returned by more than one hash function, the bit at that index is only set once. You could consider the Bloom filter to be a superposition of the set of hashes onto the fixed range of bits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The protocol described in the above-linked article divides strings into n-grams, which are in this case sets of characters. As an example, &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; might yield the following set of 2-grams:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&quot;_h&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;el&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;o_&quot;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Padding the front and back with spaces seems to be generally optional when constructing n-grams; the examples given in the paper that proposes this method use such padding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each n-gram can be hashed to produce a Bloom filter, and this set of Bloom filters can be superimposed on itself (bitwise OR operation) to produce the Bloom filter for the string.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the filter contains many more bits than there are hash functions or n-grams, arbitrary strings are relatively unlikely to produce exactly the same filter. However, the more n-grams two strings have in common, the more bits their filters will ultimately share. You can then compare any two filters &lt;code&gt;A, B&lt;/code&gt; by means of their Dice coefficient:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;A, B&lt;/sub&gt; = 2h / (a + b)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; is the number of bits that are set to 1 in both filters, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is the number of bits set to 1 in &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; filter A, and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is the number of bits set to 1 in &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; filter B. If the strings are exactly the same, the Dice coefficient will be 1; the more they differ, the closer the coefficient will be to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the hash functions are mapping an indeterminate number of unique inputs to a small number of possible bit indexes, different inputs may produce the same filter, so the coefficient indicates only a &lt;em&gt;probability&lt;/em&gt; that the strings are the same or similar. The number of different hash functions and the number of bits in the filter are important parameters for determining the likelihood of false positives - pairs of inputs that are much less similar than the Dice coefficient produced by this method predicts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to be very helpful for understanding the Bloom filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some flexibility in the implementation of this method; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uni-due.de/~hq0215/documents/2010/Bachteler_2010_An_Empirical_Comparison_Of_Approaches_To_Approximate_String_Matching_In_Private_Record_Linkage.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this 2010 paper&lt;/a&gt; (also linked at the end of the question) for some indications of how performant it is in relation to other methods, and with various parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-18T15:08:44.507" LastActivityDate="2014-06-18T15:08:44.507" CommentCount="1" />

Many similarities in to the way I’m thinking of approaching the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main issue on mapping the attributes is that the level of detail to which the product should be described depends on each buyers. Let’s take an example of a car. The product “car” has lots and lots of attributes that range from its performance, mechanical structure, price etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I just want a cheap car, or an electric car. Ok, that’s easy to map because they represent main features of this product. But let’s say, for instance, that I want a car with Dual-Clutch transmission or Xenon headlights. Well there might be many cars on the data base with this attributes but I wouldn’t ask the seller to fill in this level of detail to their product prior to the information that there is someone looking them.  Such a procedure would require every seller fill a complex, very detailed, form just try to sell his car on the platform. Just wouldn’t work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But still, my challenge is to try to be as detailed as necessary in the search to make a good match. So the way I’m thinking is mapping main aspects of the product, those that are probably relevant to everyone, to narrow down de group of potential sellers.&#xA;Next step would be a “refined search”. In order to avoid creating a too detailed form I could ask buyers and sellers to write a free text of their specification. And then use some word matching algorithm to find possible matches. Although I understand that this is not a proper solution to the problem because the seller cannot “guess” what the buyer needs.  But might get me close.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The weighting criteria suggested is great.  It allows me to quantify the level to which the seller matches the buyer’s needs.  The scaling part might be a problem though, because the importance of each attribute varies from client to client. I’m thinking of using some kind of pattern recognition or just asking de buyer to input the level of importance of each attribute. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a native English speaker so hope I’m being able to express my ideas properly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="986" LastEditorUserId="21" LastEditDate="2014-06-27T22:58:13.613" LastActivityDate="2014-06-27T22:58:13.613" Title="Preference Matching Algorithm" Tags="&lt;bigdata&gt;&lt;text-mining&gt;&lt;recommendation&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="1" />

Instead, they use transformations to expand the domain of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to all real numbers.  This transformation is called the link function.

Let’s add weights to the edges:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;for continuous features (e.g., price): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Cprice_%7Bsell%7D%20-%20price_%7Bbuy%7D%7C%7D%7B%5Cmax%28price%29%20-%20%5Cmin%28price%29%7D&quot; alt=&quot;price_weight&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;for binary and non-quantifiable features - just logical biconditional:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20feature_%7Bsell%7D%20%5Cleftrightarrow%20feature_%7Bbuy%7D&quot; alt=&quot;feature_weight&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main idea here is to &lt;strong&gt;scale&lt;/strong&gt; every feature to the interval &lt;code&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, we can use feature coefficients to determine most important features. E.g., assuming price is twice as important as availability of some rare function: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=adj.price.weight%20%3D%202%20%5Ctimes%20price.weight&quot; alt=&quot;adj_w_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=adj.feature.weight%20%3D%201%20%5Ctimes%20feature.weight&quot; alt=&quot;adj_w_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the final steps is simplifying the graph structure and reducing many edges to one edge with weight equal to the sum of the previously calculated weights of each feature. With such a reduced structure every pair of customers/products could have only one edge (no parallel edges). So, to find the best deal for exact seller you just need to select connected buyers with max weighted edges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Future challenge: introduce a cheap method for weighting edges on first step :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="941" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-20T03:28:55.463" LastActivityDate="2014-06-20T03:28:55.463" CommentCount="0" />

A &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt; operation with an average function is a little crude and sensitive to outliers, but it would probably get you close to what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possibility for the third question is to compute the difference in threat score between month &lt;code&gt;n-1&lt;/code&gt; and month &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.

The best exposition of machine learning I found is contained in Tom Mitchell's book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a more exhaustive and complete idea regarding the two cultures you can read the Leo Broiman paper called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http://strimmerlab.org/courses/ss09/current-topics/download/breiman2001.pdf&amp;amp;ei=RQGkU_DgH8Le7AaRmID4DA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGNnrlqadmBT2fZMT_NfoUQ1rEuow&amp;amp;sig2=g5qovUTsuuJUGGE64g0nrQ&quot;&gt;Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However what must be added is that even if the two sciences started with different perspectives, both of them now now share a fair amount of common knowledge and techniques. Why, because the problems were the same, but the tools were different. So now machine learning is mostly treated from a statistical perspective (check the Hastie,Tibshirani, Friedman book &lt;a href=&quot;http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/&quot;&gt;The Elements of Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; from a machine learning point of view with a statistical treatement, and perhaps Kevin P. Murphy 's book &lt;a href=&quot;http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-2&quot;&gt;Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective&lt;/a&gt;, to name just a few of the best books available today). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even the history of the development of this field show the benefits of this merge of perspectives. I will describe two events. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is the creation of CART trees, which was created by Breiman with a solid statistical background. At approximately the same time, Quinlan developed ID3,C45,See5, and so on, decision tree suite with a more computer science background. Now both this families of trees and the ensemble methods like bagging and forests become quite similar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second story is about boosting. Initially they were developed by Freund and Shapire when they discovered AdaBoost. The choices for designing AdaBoost were done mostly from a computational perspective. Even the authors did not understood well why it works. Only 5 years later Breiman (again!) described the adaboost model from a statistical perspective and gave an explanation for why that works. Since then, various eminent scientists, with both type of backgrounds, developed further those ideas leading to a Pleiads of boosting algorithms, like logistic boosting, gradient boosting, gentle boosting ans so on. It is hard now to think at boosting without a solid statistical background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GLM is a statistical development. However new Bayesian treatments puts this algorithm also in machine learning playground. So I believe both claims could be right, since the interpretation and treatment of how it works could be different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2014-06-20T10:01:03.363" CommentCount="1" />

I hope we get a bunch of real world examples of data problems and several perspectives on how best to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use p-values as they can be pretty misleading (&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/03/12/misunderstanding-the-p-value/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://occamstypewriter.org/boboh/2008/08/19/why_p_values_are_evil/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). My approach hinges on you being able to summarize traffic on a given page before and after some intervention. What you care about is the difference in the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; before and after the intervention. That is, how does the number of hits per day change? Below, I explain a first stab approach with some simulated example data. I will then explain one potential pitfall (and what I would do about it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, let's think about one page before and after an intervention. Pretend the intervention increases hits per day by roughly 15%:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&#xA;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&#xA;import seaborn as sns&#xA;&#xA;def simulate_data(true_diff=0):&#xA;    #First choose a number of days between [1, 1000] before the intervention&#xA;    num_before = np.random.randint(1, 1001)&#xA;&#xA;    #Next choose a number of days between [1, 1000] after the intervention&#xA;    num_after = np.random.randint(1, 1001)&#xA;&#xA;    #Next choose a rate for before the intervention. How many views per day on average?&#xA;    rate_before = np.random.randint(50, 151)&#xA;&#xA;    #The intervention causes a `true_diff` increase on average (but is also random)&#xA;    rate_after = np.random.normal(1 + true_diff, .1) * rate_before&#xA;&#xA;    #Simulate viewers per day:&#xA;    vpd_before = np.random.poisson(rate_before, size=num_before)&#xA;    vpd_after = np.random.poisson(rate_after, size=num_after)&#xA;&#xA;    return vpd_before, vpd_after&#xA;&#xA;vpd_before, vpd_after = simulate_data(.15)&#xA;&#xA;plt.hist(vpd_before, histtype=&quot;step&quot;, bins=20, normed=True, lw=2)&#xA;plt.hist(vpd_after, histtype=&quot;step&quot;, bins=20, normed=True, lw=2)&#xA;plt.legend((&quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;))&#xA;plt.title(&quot;Views per day before and after intervention&quot;)&#xA;plt.xlabel(&quot;Views per day&quot;)&#xA;plt.ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;)&#xA;plt.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/FJJqD.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of hits per day before and after the intervention&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can clearly see that the intervention increased the number of hits per day, on average. But in order to quantify the difference in rates, we should use one company's intervention for multiple pages. Since the underlying rate will be different for each page, we should compute the percent change in rate (again, the rate here is hits per day).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's pretend we have data for &lt;code&gt;n = 100&lt;/code&gt; pages, each of which received an intervention from the same company. To get the percent difference we take (mean(hits per day before) - mean(hits per day after)) / mean(hits per day before):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;n = 100&#xA;&#xA;pct_diff = np.zeros(n)&#xA;&#xA;for i in xrange(n):&#xA;    vpd_before, vpd_after = simulate_data(.15)&#xA;    # % difference. Note: this is the thing we want to infer&#xA;    pct_diff[i] = (vpd_after.mean() - vpd_before.mean()) / vpd_before.mean()&#xA;&#xA;plt.hist(pct_diff)&#xA;plt.title(&quot;Distribution of percent change&quot;)&#xA;plt.xlabel(&quot;Percent change&quot;)&#xA;plt.ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;)&#xA;plt.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CAitf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of percent change&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we have the distribution of our parameter of interest! We can query this result in different ways. For example, we might want to know the mode, or (approximation of) the most likely value for this percent change:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def mode_continuous(x, num_bins=None):&#xA;    if num_bins is None:&#xA;        counts, bins = np.histogram(x)&#xA;    else:&#xA;        counts, bins = np.histogram(x, bins=num_bins)&#xA;&#xA;    ndx = np.argmax(counts)&#xA;    return bins[ndx:(ndx+1)].mean()&#xA;&#xA;mode_continuous(pct_diff, 20)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I ran this I got 0.126, which is not bad, considering our true percent change is 15. We can also see the number of positive changes, which approximates the probability that a given company's intervention improves hits per day:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pct_diff &amp;gt; 0).mean()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, my result is 0.93, so we could say there's a pretty good chance that this company is effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a potential pitfall: Each page probably has some underlying trend that you should probably account for. That is, even without the intervention, hits per day may increase. To account for this, I would estimate a simple linear regression where the outcome variable is hits per day and the independent variable is day (start at day=0 and simply increment for all the days in your sample). Then subtract the estimate, y_hat, from each number of hits per day to de-trend your data. Then you can do the above procedure and be confident that a positive percent difference is not due to the underlying trend. Of course, the trend may not be linear, so use discretion!

Basically, everyone in marketing would come up with a crazy idea that the sold to higher ups as the single event that would boost KPI's by 2000%.  The higher ups would approve them and then they would begin their &quot;test&quot;.  Results would come back, and management would dump it on the data analysts to determine what worked and who did it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is you cant really know if it wasn't run as a random A/B style test on like time periods.  But I am very aware of how deficient that answer is, especially if the fact that a pure answer doesn't exist is irrelevant to the urgency of future business decisions.  Here are some of the techniques I would use to salvage the analysis in this situation, bear in mind this is more of an art then a science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A handle is something that exists in the data that you can hold onto.  From what you are telling me in your situation you have a lot of info on who the marketing agency is, when they tried a tactic, and to which site they applied it to.  These are your starting point and information like this going to be the corner stone of your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methodology is going to probably hold the strongest impact on which agencies are given credit for any and all gains so you are going to need to make sure that it is clearly outlines and all stake holders agree that it makes sense.  If you cant do that it is going to be difficult for people to trust your analysis.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of this are conversions. Say the marketing department purchases some leads and they arrive at our landing page, we would track them for 3 days, if they made a purchase within that time we would count them as having been converted.  Why 3 days, why not 5 or 1?  Thats not important as long as everyone agrees, you now have a definition you can build off of.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparisons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal would you would have a nice A/B test to prove a definitive relationship, I am going to assume that you are running short on those, still, you can learn something from a simple comparison of like data.  When companies are trying to determine the efficacy of radio advertising they will often run ads on offset months in the same market, or for several months in one market and compare that with the results in a separate but similar market.  Its doesn't pass for science, but even with all that noise a strong results will almost always be noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would combine these in your case to determine how long an event is given to register an effect.  Once you have the data from that time period run it against your modeled out traffic prediction, week over week growth, month over month etc. Which, can then allow a meaningful comparison between agencies, and across time periods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pragmatism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aspiration is to be able to provide a deep understanding of cause and effect, but it is probably not realistic.  Because of how messy outside factors make your analysis, you are constantly going to run up against the question over and over again: Did this event raise volume/sales/click throughs, or would doing anything at all have had the same effect?  The best advise I can give for this is set very realistic goals for what you are looking to measure.  A good starting point is, within the methodology you have, which event had the largest impact.  Once you have those open your aperture from there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have reasoned out all of these aspects you can go about building a general solution which can then be automated.  The advantage to designing your solution in this manner is that the business logic is already built in.  This will make your results much more approachable and intuitive to non-technical business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="780" LastActivityDate="2014-06-20T16:29:27.673" CommentCount="1" />

The issue I am facing is that the data is very biased or rather sparse. After normalization and scaling the data along with some feature engineering and using a couple of different algorithms, these are the best results I could achieve:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mean square error : 0.00804710026904&#xA;Confusion matrix : [[82214   667]&#xA;                   [    0     6]]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i.e only 6 correct positive hits.

Any scientists who claim that their work is entirely objective and rational are in denial about the nature of science; every single model we create is informed by our biases and perspectives. The key is that we each have different biases and perspectives, which is one reason that science is the pursuit of a society, not of individuals, and underscores the importance of peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have already identified some trade-offs between an algorithmic solution and individual/case-by-case corrections. If we have training as scientists, we may be used to thinking that everything has to be applied as an overall rule, so we may bend over backwards to find correlations and fit curves to data that just won't reasonably accept it. Applying an algorithm to the entire data set can be powerful when it works, but it's not the only tool at your disposal. Sometimes you need to use your judgment as the scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, if you use your individual judgment to make exceptions and to manually correct your data, be prepared to defend your judgment and argue your case. Be prepared to show that you considered all the data. If you're going to manually correct 8 observations out of a set of 100,000, you need to do more than justify those 8 manual corrections - you also need to justify &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; correcting the other 99,992 observations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can still take a methodical approach, perhaps by classifying your data in a systematic way, and choosing which subset of the data to apply your cleaning algorithm to based on that system of classification. And when you do this, you document it, you make your case, and you respect the judgment of your colleagues in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, why do all this extra work before you know it's necessary? Plenty of &quot;dirty&quot; data sets will still produce useful results. Perhaps 0.5% of your data is &quot;dirty&quot; in a way that you know will have a bad influence on your end product. Well, any analysis is subject to error, and the more you obsess over that 0.5% the more you will start to think of it and treat it like it was 5%, or 25% - much more significant than it truly is. Try to apply your analysis while admitting you know there is some error, and only do extra work to clean the data once you can show for certain that your analysis fails or is not useful otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;For example...&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say you have a set of test results from a survey of wells, showing the concentrations of certain dissolved substances, hourly over the course of a year. And you observe in this set certain spikes, of short duration, and orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding data. If they are few, and obvious, and you know that the sensors used to produce the data set occasionally malfunction, then there's no reason to apply an algorithmic solution to the entire data set. You have a choice between excluding some data or modifying it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend the exclusion route whenever possible, since you are making fewer assumptions when you don't have to additionally choose a &quot;correct&quot; value. But if your analysis will absolutely fail with a discontinuity, there are many options. You could choose to replace &quot;bad&quot; values via linear interpolation. You could hold constant the previous value. If there is some great previous literature to apply, and you really have a strong case that the &quot;bad&quot; data is purely due to equipment malfunction, perhaps there's an established model that you can apply to fill in those regions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a great many approaches, which is why the most important thing is to document your process, explicitly and exhaustively. Arguing your case is important too, but not strictly necessary; the community is just more likely to ignore you if you don't make a full effort to engage the review process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-23T16:14:33.900" LastActivityDate="2014-06-23T16:14:33.900" CommentCount="2" />

If you want all positive numbers, you can add a positive constant to move all results above zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is how to do it mathematically, but I suggest that you consider whether it is wise, from a data analysis point of view, to normalize by school size.

I did the following approach:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rather than associating data to ages (15 y.o., 27 y.o., ...) what I did is to establish different groups of ages: Less than 18, from 18 to 30 and greater than 30 (this is due to the specific problem we were facing, but you can choose whatever intervals you want). This division helps a lot to solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Afterwards, I created a hierarchical clustering (divisive or aggregative).

You can use a bunch of different technics to complete this task, but my vote is for simplest ones (KISS, yes). E.g., in my case, for age prediction, mean of ego-network users' ages gave satisfactory results (for about 70% of users error was less than +/-3 years, in my case it was enough). It's just an idea, but you can try to use for age prediction weighted average, defining weight as similarity measure between visited sites sets of current user and others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Evaluating prediction quality. Algorithm from task-1 will produce prediction almost in all cases. And second task is to determine, if prediction is reliable. E.g., in case of ego network and age prediction: can we trust in prediction, if a user has only one 'friend' in his ego network? This task is more about machine-learning: it's a binary classification problem. You need to compose features set, form training and test samples from your data with both right and wrong predictions. Creating appropriate classifier will help you to filter out unpredictable users. But you need to determine, what are your features set. I used a number of network metrics, and summary statistics on feature of interest distribution among ego-network.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This approach wouldn't populate all the gaps, but only predictable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="941" LastActivityDate="2014-06-27T07:06:14.297" CommentCount="0" />

I would suggest to start with a basic validation approach for finding out lambda, whether you are doing batch or per-item learning. This is the easiest and safest approach. Try manually with a number of different values. e.g. 0.001. 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 etc. and see how your validation set behaves. Later on you may automate this process by introducing a linear or local search method. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I believe the value of lambda should be considered in relation to the updates of the parameter vector, rather than the training set size.

Then you will reconstruct it via x' = f(x). You then reset the values of x' with those you know from x. (I.e. you only keep the values that were missing before reconstruction.)

In most basic terms, it acts as a layer interfacing between the virtual OS, and your own OS which then communicates with the lower level hardware to provide support to the virtual OS. What this means for you is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Cons&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Hardware Support&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A drawback of virtual machine technology is that it supports only the hardware that both the virtual machine hypervisor and the guest operating system support. Even if the guest operating system supports the physical hardware, it sees only the virtual hardware presented by the virtual machine. &#xA;The second aspect of virtual machine hardware support is the hardware presented to the guest operating system. No matter the hardware in the host, the hardware presented to the guest environment is usually the same (with the exception of the CPU, which shows through). For example, VMware GSX Server presents an AMD PCnet32 Fast Ethernet card or an optimized VMware-proprietary network card, depending on which you choose. The network card in the host machine does not matter. VMware GSX Server performs the translation between the guest environment's network card and the host environment's network card. This is great for standardization, but it also means that host hardware that VMware does not understand will not be present in the guest environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Performance Penalty&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Virtual machine technology imposes a performance penalty from running an additional layer above the physical hardware but beneath the guest operating system. The performance penalty varies based on the virtualization software used and the guest software being run. This is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Pros&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons to employ virtualization is to isolate applications from each other. Running everything on one machine would be great if it all worked, but many times it results in undesirable interactions or even outright conflicts. The cause often is software problems or business requirements, such as the need for isolated security. Virtual machines allow you to isolate each application (or group of applications) in its own sandbox environment. The virtual machines can run on the same physical machine (simplifying IT hardware management), yet appear as independent machines to the software you are running. For all intents and purposes—except performance, the virtual machines are independent machines. If one virtual machine goes down due to application or operating system error, the others continue running, providing services your business needs to function smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Standardization&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Another key benefit virtual machines provide is standardization. The hardware that is presented to the guest operating system is uniform for the most part, usually with the CPU being the only component that is &quot;pass-through&quot; in the sense that the guest sees what is on the host. A standardized hardware platform reduces support costs and increases the share of IT resources that you can devote to accomplishing goals that give your business a competitive advantage. The host machines can be different (as indeed they often are when hardware is acquired at different times), but the virtual machines will appear to be the same across all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Ease of Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Virtual machines let you test scenarios easily. Most virtual machine software today provides snapshot and rollback capabilities. This means you can stop a virtual machine, create a snapshot, perform more operations in the virtual machine, and then roll back again and again until you have finished your testing. This is very handy for software development, but it is also useful for system administration. Admins can snapshot a system and install some software or make some configuration changes that they suspect may destabilize the system. If the software installs or changes work, then the admin can commit the updates. If the updates damage or destroy the system, the admin can roll them back.&#xA;  Virtual machines also facilitate scenario testing by enabling virtual networks. In VMware Workstation, for example, you can set up multiple virtual machines on a virtual network with configurable parameters, such as packet loss from congestion and latency. You can thus test timing-sensitive or load-sensitive applications to see how they perform under the stress of a simulated heavy workload.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Mobility&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Virtual machines are easy to move between physical machines. Most of the virtual machine software on the market today stores a whole disk in the guest environment as a single file in the host environment. Snapshot and rollback capabilities are implemented by storing the change in state in a separate file in the host information. Having a single file represent an entire guest environment disk promotes the mobility of virtual machines. Transferring the virtual machine to another physical machine is as easy as moving the virtual disk file and some configuration files to the other physical machine. Deploying another copy of a virtual machine is the same as transferring a virtual machine, except that instead of moving the files, you copy them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Which VM should I use if I am starting out?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Data Science Box or the Data Science Toolbox are your best bets if you just getting into data science. They have the basic software that you will need, with the primary difference being the virtual environment in which each of these can run. The DSB can run on AWS while the DST can run on Virtual Box (which is the most common tool used for VMs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Sources&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devx.com/vmspecialreport/Article/30383&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.devx.com/vmspecialreport/Article/30383&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2014-06-30T01:51:11.027" CommentCount="1" />

You can adapt this strategy and instead of creating a wordcloud, you can create a frequency matrix of terms used.  The idea is to take the unstructured text and structure it somehow.  You change everything to lowercase (or uppercase), remove stop words, and find frequent terms for each job function, via Document Term Matrices.  You also have the option of stemming the words.  If you stem words you will be able to detect different forms of words as the same word.  For example, 'programed' and 'programming' could be stemmed to 'program'.  You can possibly add the occurrence of these frequent terms as a weighted feature in your ML model training.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also adapt this to frequent phrases, finding common groups of 2-3 words for each job function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Load libraries and build the example data&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tm)&#xA;library(SnowballC)&#xA;&#xA;doc1 = &quot;I am highly skilled in Java Programming.

You can keep only specific (more common) words and use them as features in your model.  Another way is to keep it simple and have a percentage of words used in each job description, say &quot;java&quot; would have 80% occurrence in 'software engineer' and only 50% occurrence in 'quality assurance'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to go look up why 'assurance' has 1 'r' and 'occurrence' has 2 'r's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="375" LastEditorUserId="375" LastEditDate="2014-07-03T22:52:29.253" LastActivityDate="2014-07-03T22:52:29.253" CommentCount="2" />

I guess, resumes can be treated as semi-structured documents. Sometimes, it's beneficial to have some minimal structure in the documents. I believe, in resumes you would see some tabular data. You might want to treat these as attribute value pairs. For example, you would get a list of terms for the attribute &quot;Skill set&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key idea is to manually configure a list of key phrases such as &quot;skill&quot;, &quot;education&quot;, &quot;publication&quot; etc. The next step is to extract terms which pertain to these key phrases either by exploiting the structure in some way (such as tables) or by utilizing the proximity of terms around these key phrases, e.g. the fact that the word &quot;Java&quot; is in close proximity to the term &quot;skill&quot; might indicate that the person is skilled in Java.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you extract these information, the next step could be to build up a feature vector for each of these key phrases. You can then represent a document as a vector with different fields (one each for a key phrase). For example, consider the following two resumes represented with two fields, namely &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;education&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doc1: {project: (java, 3) (c, 4)}, {education: (computer, 2), (physics, 1)}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doc2: {project: (java, 3) (python, 2)}, {education: (maths, 3), (computer, 2)}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, I show a term with the frequency. Of course, while extracting the terms you need to stem and remove stop-words. It is clear from the examples that the person whose resume is Doc1 is more skilled in C than that of D2. Implementation wise, it's very easy to represent documents as field vectors in Lucene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the next step is to retrieve a ranked list of resumes given a job specification. In fact, that's fairly straight forward if you represent queries (job specs) as field vectors as well. You just need to retrieve a ranked list of candidates (resumes) using Lucene from a collection of indexed resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="984" LastActivityDate="2014-07-03T20:47:20.147" CommentCount="6" />

Gensim's implementations are very fast however, as it uses iterative SVD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other note, if you use word2vec, you will still have to determine a way to compose vectors from documents, as it gives you a different vector per word. The simplest way to do this is to normalize each vector and take the mean over all word vectors in the document, or take a weighted mean by idf weighting of each word. So it's not as simple as 'use word2vec', you will need to do something further to compute document similarity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would personally go with LSA, as I have seen it work well empirically, and gensim's library scales very well.

Firstly, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apriori&lt;/a&gt; algorithm was proposed in 1993, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=170072&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Agrawal et al.&lt;/a&gt;, along with the formalization of the problem. The algorithm was able to &lt;em&gt;strip-off&lt;/em&gt; some sets from the &lt;code&gt;2^n - 1&lt;/code&gt; sets (powerset) by using a lattice to maintain the data. A drawback of the approach was the need to re-read the database to compute the frequency of each set expanded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, on year 1997, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tk/2000/03/k0372-abs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zaki et al.&lt;/a&gt; proposed the algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_Eclat_Algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eclat&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;inserted&lt;/em&gt; the resulting frequency of each set inside the lattice. This was done by adding, at each node of the lattice, the set of transaction-ids that had the items from root to the referred node. The main contribution is that one does not have to re-read the entire dataset to know the frequency of each set, but the memory required to keep such data structure built may exceed the size of the dataset itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=335191.335372&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Han et al.&lt;/a&gt; proposed an algorithm named &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_FP-Growth_Algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FPGrowth&lt;/a&gt;, along with a prefix-tree data structure named FPTree. The algorithm was able to provide significant data compression, while also granting that only frequent itemsets would be yielded (without candidate itemset generation). This was done mainly by sorting the items of each transaction in decreasing order, so that the most frequent items are the ones with the least repetitions in the tree data structure. Since the frequency only descends while traversing the tree in-depth, the algorithm is able to &lt;em&gt;strip-off&lt;/em&gt; non-frequent itemsets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;As far as I know, this may be considered a state-of-the-art algorithm, but I'd like to know about other proposed solutions.

Tools that help in report generation and presentation is also a large category, where &lt;code&gt;Sweave&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; are probably the most well-known ones. &lt;code&gt;Sweave&lt;/code&gt; is a tool, focused on R, but it can be integrated with Python-based projects, albeit with some additional effort (&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161152/sweave-for-python&quot;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161152/sweave-for-python&lt;/a&gt;). I think that &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; might be a better option, as it's modern, has extensive support by popular tools (such as &lt;code&gt;RStudio&lt;/code&gt;) and is language-neutral (&lt;a href=&quot;http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines&quot;&gt;http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Protocol and suggested directory structure&lt;/strong&gt;. If I understood correctly what you implied by using term &lt;em&gt;protocol&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;workflow&lt;/em&gt;), generally I think that standard RR data analysis workflow consists of the following sequential phases: &lt;em&gt;data collection&lt;/em&gt; =&gt; &lt;em&gt;data preparation&lt;/em&gt; (cleaning, transformation, merging, sampling) =&gt; &lt;em&gt;data analysis&lt;/em&gt; =&gt; &lt;em&gt;presentation of results&lt;/em&gt; (generating reports and/or presentations). Nevertheless, every workflow is project-specific and, thus, some specific tasks might require adding additional steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For sample directory structure, you may take a look at documentation for R package &lt;code&gt;ProjectTemplate&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://projecttemplate.net&quot;&gt;http://projecttemplate.net&lt;/a&gt;), as an attempt to automate data analysis workflows and projects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0B2vo.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Automated build/run tools&lt;/strong&gt;. Since my answer is focused on universal (language-neutral) RR tools, the most popular tools is &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;. Read the following article for some reasons to use &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; as the preferred RR workflow automation tool: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make&quot;&gt;http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly, there are other &lt;strong&gt;similar&lt;/strong&gt; tools, which either improve some aspects of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, or add some additional features. For example: &lt;code&gt;ant&lt;/code&gt; (officially, Apache Ant: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ant.apache.org&quot;&gt;http://ant.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;Maven&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;next generation &lt;code&gt;ant&lt;/code&gt;&quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org&quot;&gt;http://maven.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/rake&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ruby/rake&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;Makepp&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://makepp.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;http://makepp.sourceforge.net&lt;/a&gt;).

And in general, all the other good things that software engineering has created along decades for ensuring isolation and reproductibility. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to stress that it is not enough to have &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; reproducible workflows, but also &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to reproduce workflows. Let me show what I mean. Suppose that your project uses Python, a database X and Scipy. Most surely you will be using a specific library to connect to your database from Python, and Scipy will be in turn using some sparse algebraic routines. This is by all means a very simple setup, but not entirely simple to setup, pun intended. If somebody wants to execute your scripts, she will have to install all the dependencies. Or worse, she might have incompatible versions of it already installed. Fixing those things takes time. It will also take time to you if you at some moment need to move your computations to a cluster, to a different cluster, or to some cloud servers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is where I find docker useful. Docker is a way to formalize and compile recipes for binary environments. You can write the following in a dockerfile (I'm using here plain English instead of the Dockerfile syntax):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start with a basic binary environment, like Ubuntu's&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install libsparse-dev&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Pip) Install numpy and scipy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install X&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install libX-dev&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Pip) Install python-X&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install IPython-Notebook&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Copy my python scripts/notebooks to my binary environment, these datafiles, and these configurations to do other miscellaneous things. To ensure reproductibility, copy them from a named url instead of a local file. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maybe run IPython-Notebook.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the lines will be installing things in Python using pip, since pip can do a very clean work in selecting specific package versions. Check it out too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that's it. If after you create your Dockerfile it can be built, then it can be built anywhere, by anybody (provided they also have access to your project-specific files, e.g. because you put them in a public url referenced from the Dockerfile). What is best, you can upload the resulting environment (called an &quot;image&quot;) to a public or private server (called a &quot;register&quot;) for other people to use. So, when you publish your workflow, you have both a fully reproducible recipe in the form of a Dockerfile, and an easy way for you or other people to reproduce what you do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or if they want to poke around in your scripts and so forth:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -i -t dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme /bin/bash&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2575" LastActivityDate="2014-07-18T07:43:56.823" CommentCount="0" />

I mention this, because it forces data scientists and other analysts to look for and use R packages that focus on &lt;strong&gt;other than volume&lt;/strong&gt; aspects of big data (enabled by the &lt;strong&gt;richness&lt;/strong&gt; of enormous &lt;em&gt;R ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) While existing answers mention some R packages, related to big data, for a more &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive coverage&lt;/strong&gt;, I'd recommend to refer to &lt;em&gt;CRAN Task View&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&quot;High-Performance and Parallel Computing with R&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html&quot;&gt;http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html&lt;/a&gt;), in particular, sections &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Parallel computing: Hadoop&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Large memory and out-of-memory data&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2452" LastActivityDate="2014-07-19T02:19:46.530" CommentCount="0" />

First though, let's talk about exactly what &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; is. Honestly, for being one of the most widely used efficacy metrics, it's surprisingly obtuse to figure out exactly how &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; stands for &lt;code&gt;Area Under the Curve&lt;/code&gt;, which curve you ask? Well that would be the &lt;code&gt;ROC&lt;/code&gt; curve. &lt;code&gt;ROC&lt;/code&gt; stands for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic&quot;&gt;Receiver Operating Characteristic&lt;/a&gt;, which is actually slightly non-intuitive. The implicit goal of &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; is to deal with situations where you have a very skewed sample distribution, and don't want to overfit to a single class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great example is in spam detection. Generally spam data sets are STRONGLY biased towards ham, or not-spam. If your data set is 90% ham, you can get a pretty damn good accuracy by just saying that every single email is ham, which is obviously something that indicates a non-ideal classifier. Let's start with a couple of metrics that are a little more useful for us, specifically the true positive rate (&lt;code&gt;TPR&lt;/code&gt;) and the false positive rate (&lt;code&gt;FPR&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/hNxTl.png&quot; alt=&quot;ROC axes&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now in this graph, &lt;code&gt;TPR&lt;/code&gt; is specifically the ratio of true positive to all positives, and &lt;code&gt;FPR&lt;/code&gt; is the ratio of false positives to all negatives. (Keep in mind, this is only for binary classification.) On a graph like this, it should be pretty straightforward to figure out that a prediction of all 0's or all 1's will result in the points of &lt;code&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(1,1)&lt;/code&gt; respectively. If you draw a line through these lines you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/B1WT1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kind of like a triangle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which looks basically like a diagonal line (it is), and by some easy geometry, you can see that the &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; of such a model would be &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt; (height and base are both 1). Similarly, if you predict a random assortment of 0's and 1's, let's say 90% 1's, you could get the point &lt;code&gt;(0.9, 0.9)&lt;/code&gt;, which again falls along that diagonal line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now comes the interesting part. What if we weren't only predicting 0's and 1's? What if instead we wanted to say that, theoretically we were going to set a cutoff, above which every result was a 1, and below which every result were a 0. This would mean that at the extremes you get the original situation where you have all 0's and all 1's (at a cutoff of 0 and 1 respectively), but also a series of intermediate states that fall within the &lt;code&gt;1x1&lt;/code&gt; graph that contains your &lt;code&gt;ROC&lt;/code&gt;. In practice you get something like this:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/13McM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Courtesy of Wikipedia&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically, what you're actually getting when you do an &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; over accuracy is something that will strongly discourage people going for models that are representative, but not discriminative, as this will only actually select for models that achieve false positive and true positive rates that are significantly above random chance, which is not guaranteed for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="548" LastActivityDate="2014-07-22T04:10:18.353" CommentCount="2" />

For basic analytics and reporting statistics will certainly help, but for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence then you'll want a few more skills&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probability theory&lt;/strong&gt; - you must have a solid background in pure probability so that you can decompose any problem, whether seen before or not, into probabilistic principles.  Statistics helps a lot for already solved problems, but new and unsolved problems require a deep understanding of probability so that you can design appropriate techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Theory&lt;/strong&gt; - this (relative to statistics) is quite a new field (though still decades old), the most important work was by Shannon, but even more important and often neglected note in literature is work by Hobson that proved that Kullback-Leibler Divergence is the only mathematical definition that truly captures the notion of a &lt;em&gt;&quot;measure of information&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Now fundamental to artificial intellgence is being able to quantify information.  Suggest reading &quot;Concepts in Statistical Mechanics&quot; - Arthur Hobson (very expensive book, only available in academic libraries).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity Theory&lt;/strong&gt; - A big problem many Data Scientists face that do not have a solid complexity theory background is that their algorithms do not scale, or just take an extremely long time to run on large data.  Take PCA for example, many peoples favourite answer to the interview question &quot;how do you reduce the number of features in our dataset&quot;, but even if you tell the candidate &quot;the data set is really really really large&quot; they still propose various forms of PCA that are O(n^3).  If you want to stand out, you want to be able to solve each problem on it's own, NOT throw some text book solution at it designed a long time ago before Big Data was such a hip thing.  For that you need to understand how long things take to run, not only theoretically, but practically - so how to use a cluster of computers to distribute an algorithm, or which data structures take up less memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Skills&lt;/strong&gt; - A huge part of Data Science is understanding business.  Whether it's inventing a product driven by data science, or giving business insight driven by data science, being able to communicate well with both the Project and Product Managers, the tech teams, and your fellow data scientists is very important.  You can have an amazing idea, say an awesome AI solution, but if you cannot effectively (a) communicate WHY that will make the business money, (b) convince your collegues it will work and (c) explain to tech people how you need their help to build it, then it wont get done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2668" LastActivityDate="2014-07-22T21:12:08.333" CommentCount="0" />

That commonly happens by random chance.  To a certain degree this can be taken care of by covariate adjusted randomization.  It can also be taken care of by adding covariates to the model that tests the effect of the design decision.  It should be noted that there is still some discussion about the proper way to do this within the statistics community.

There's one subtlety, though - job titles are too short to carry important context. Let me explain this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine LinkedIn profiles (which is pretty good source for data). Normally, they contain 4-10 sentences describing person's skills and qualifications. It's pretty likely that you find phrases like &quot;lead data scientist&quot; and &quot;professional knowledge of Matlab and R&quot; in a same profile, but it's very unlikely to also see &quot;junior Java developer&quot; in it. So we may say that &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; (as well as &quot;data scientist&quot; and &quot;Matlab&quot; and &quot;R&quot;) often occur in same contexts, but they are rarely found together with &quot;junior&quot; and &quot;Java&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Co-occurrence matrix shows exactly this. The more 2 words occur in same context, the more similar their vectors in the matrix will look like. And cosine distance is just a good way to measure this similarity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what about job titles? Normally they are much shorter and don't actually create enough context to catch similarities. Luckily, you don't need source data to be titles themselves - you need to find similarities between skills in general, not specifically in titles. So you can simply build co-occurrence matrix from (long) profiles and then use it to measure similarity of titles. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt; - in fact, it's already worked for me on a similar project. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-07-23T15:46:48.977" CommentCount="0" />

Consider following example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rdd = sc.parallelize(range(5))&#xA;rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x + 1)&#xA;rdd.collect()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you have distributed collection and lambda function to send to all workers. Lambda is completely self-containing, so it's easy to copy its binary representation to other nodes without any worries. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's make things a bit more interesting: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f = open(&quot;/etc/hosts&quot;)&#xA;rdd = sc.parallelize(range(100))&#xA;rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: f.read())&#xA;rdd.collect()&#xA;f.close()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boom!

Obviously, file object is a handle to &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; data and thus cannot be sent to other machines. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's happening in your specific code? Without actual data and knowing record format, I cannot debug it completely, but I guess that problem goes from this line: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def vectorizer(text, vocab=vocab_dict):&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Python, keyword arguments are initialized when function is called for the first time. When you call &lt;code&gt;sc.parallelize(...).map(vectorizer)&lt;/code&gt; just after its definition, &lt;code&gt;vocab_dict&lt;/code&gt; is available &lt;em&gt;locally&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;remote&lt;/em&gt; workers know absolutely nothing about it. Thus function is called with fewer parameters than it expects which results in &lt;code&gt;__init__() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)&lt;/code&gt; error. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note, that you follow very bad pattern of  &lt;code&gt;sc.parallelize(...)...collect()&lt;/code&gt; calls. First you spread your collection to entire cluster, do some computations, and then pull the result. But sending data back and forth is pretty pointless here. Instead, you can just do these computations locally, and run Spark's parallel processes only when you work with really big datasets (like you main &lt;code&gt;amazon_dataset&lt;/code&gt;, I guess).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-07-26T00:11:03.637" CommentCount="1" />

It uses machine learning, statistics and other fields to simplify (or even automate) decision making. Data science techniques may work with any data size, but more data means better predictions and thus more precise decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadoop&lt;/strong&gt; is a common name for a set of tools intended to work with large amounts of data. Two most important components in Hadoop are HDFS and MapReduce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDFS&lt;/strong&gt;, or Hadoop Distributed File System, is a special distributed storage capable of holding really large data amounts. Large files on HDFS are split into blocks, and for each block HDFS API exposes its &lt;em&gt;location&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MapReduce&lt;/strong&gt; is framework for running computations on nodes with data. MapReduce heavily uses &lt;em&gt;data locality&lt;/em&gt; exposed by HDFS: when possible, data is not transferred between nodes, but instead code is copied to the nodes with data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically any problem (including data science tasks) that doesn't break data locality principle may be efficiently implemented using MapReduce (and a number of other problems may be solved not that efficiently, but still simply enough).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's take some examples. Very often analyst only needs some simple statistics over his tabular data. In this case &lt;a href=&quot;https://hive.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically SQL engine over MapReduce, works pretty well (there are also Impala, Shark and others, but they don't use Hadoop's MapReduce, so more on them later). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other cases analyst (or developer) may want to work with previously unstructured data. Pure MapReduce is pretty good for &lt;strong&gt;transforming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;standardizing&lt;/strong&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people are used to exploratory statistics and visualization using tools like R. It's possible to apply this approach to big data amounts using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHadoop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to MapReduce-based machine learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://mahout.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache Mahout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first to mention. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's, however, one type of algorithms that work pretty slowly on Hadoop even in presence of data locality, namely, iterative algorithms. Iterative algorithms tend to have multiple Map and Reduce stages. Hadoop's MR framework &lt;strong&gt;reads&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;writes&lt;/strong&gt; data to disk on each stage (and sometimes in between), which makes iterative (as well as any multi-stage) tasks terribly slow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are alternative frameworks that can both - use data locality and keep data in memory between stages. Probably, the most notable of them is &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spark is complete replacement for Hadoop's MapReduce that uses its own runtime and exposes pretty rich API for manipulating your distributed dataset. Spark has several sub-projects, closely related to data science: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shark.cs.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/sql/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  provide alternative SQL-like interfaces to data stored on HDFS&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/streaming/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark Streaming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to work with continuous data streams (e.g. Twitter feed)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/mllib/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MLlib&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; implements a number of machine learning algorithms with a pretty simple and flexible API&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/graphx/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enables large-scale graph processing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there's pretty large set of data science problems that you can solve with Hadoop and related projects. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-07-29T13:43:39.060" CommentCount="4" />

To be more precise, it works best when the result can be found from the result of some function of a partition of the input. Averaging is a trivial example; you can do this with map/reduce by summing each partition, returning the sum and the number of elements in the partition, then computing the overall mean using these intermediate results. It is less appropriate when the intermediate steps depend on the state of the other partitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastActivityDate="2014-07-30T07:49:14.467" CommentCount="0" />

The use-case I've got is a &quot;recommendation engine&quot; for movies a user has watched. Movies have lots of string data (title, plot, tags), and I could imagine &quot;downsampling&quot; the text down to a few key words that describe that movie, but even if I parse out the top five words that describe this movie, I think I'd need input neurons for every english word in order to compare a set of movies? I could limit the input neurons just to the words used in the set, but then could it grow/learn by adding new movies (user watches a new movie, with new words)? Most of the libraries I've seen don't allow adding new neurons after the system has been trained?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a standard way to map string/word/character data to inputs into a neural network?

In other words, you have a vector of length n, where n is the number of words in your vocabulary, and each word corresponds to an element in the vector.  In order to convert text to numeric data, you simply count the number of occurrences of each word and place that value at the index of the vector that corresponds to the word. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model.&quot;&gt;Wikipedia does an excellent job of describing this conversion process.&lt;/a&gt;  Because the length of the vector is fixed, its difficult to deal with new words that don't map to an index, but there are ways to help mitigate this problem (lookup &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing&quot;&gt;feature hashing&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method of representation has many disadvantages -- it does not preserve the relationship between adjacent words, and results in very sparse vectors.  Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram&quot;&gt;n-grams&lt;/a&gt; helps to fix the problem of preserving word relationships, but for now let's focus on the second problem: sparsity.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to deal directly with these sparse vectors (many linear algebra libraries do a poor job of handling sparse inputs), so often the next step is dimensionality reduction. For that we can refer to the field of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model&quot;&gt;topic modeling&lt;/a&gt;:  Techniques like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation&quot;&gt;Latent Dirichlet Allocation&lt;/a&gt; (LDA) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis&quot;&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis&lt;/a&gt; (LSA) allow the compression of these sparse vectors into dense vectors by representing a document as a combination of topics.  You can fix the number of topics used, and in doing so fix the size of the output vector producted by LDA or LSA. This dimensionality reduction process drastically reduces the size of the input vector while attempting to lose a minimal amount of information.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, after all of these conversions, you can feed the outputs of the topic modeling process into the inputs of your neural network.     &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="684" LastActivityDate="2014-07-30T17:53:40.330" CommentCount="3" />

With &lt;strong&gt;Learning Curve&lt;/strong&gt;, you can evaluate your experiments &lt;em&gt;learning ability&lt;/em&gt;. To talk a bit more, you will &lt;strong&gt;fix&lt;/strong&gt; commodity configuration, and then will run same experiment on the same number of machines with different size of data set you have (from starting from small chunk in size, incrementally increase the size until you reach the whole data set). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To point on, you should avoid having &lt;em&gt;power distribution&lt;/em&gt; for result of performance test being run with different size of data sets. To avoid, you should carefully choose &lt;em&gt;step size&lt;/em&gt; (step size = amount of increments).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have about ten machines available, each with 200 GB of free space on hard disk. However, I would like to perform experiments on a greater number of nodes, to measure scalability more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this type question, I have intuitively searched and read materials; afterwards, published as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/scale-your-vision&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the post, I have briefly talked about how to test your hypothesis on real complex system. If you let me, I want to briefly talk about;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;base requirement&lt;/strong&gt; should be formed in order to run data set as a whole. The minimum requirement will build your &lt;strong&gt;baseline evaluation score&lt;/strong&gt; which is calculated with one/combination of evaluation metrics you have chosen, or with one/combination of methods being used to calculate &lt;code&gt;Running Time = Computation complexity + Communication cost + Synchronization cost&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After those steps, with an &lt;em&gt;evaluation strategy&lt;/em&gt;, add new elements, e.g. new node, to the system you have doing scalability test; meanwhile, for each addition, measure performance w.r.t new system configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to note, &lt;em&gt;evaluation strategy&lt;/em&gt; must be planned along with considerations of default behavior of parallel and distributed systems. For example, what I mean by behavior is that adding just more cores will, after some point, automatically drop performance of the system not due to your algorithm characteristics. It is because more cores need more RAMs, more hard driver, or etc. In other words, there is a &lt;strong&gt;N-Way&lt;/strong&gt; relationship between hardware components.

Different models, such as random forests, regression, etc. could capture only part of relations and ignore others. In such circumstances it makes sense to use general &lt;strong&gt;statistical exploration&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;modelling&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, the very first thing I would do is finding out &lt;strong&gt;correlations&lt;/strong&gt; between possible precursor conditions and diagnoses. E.g. in what percent of cases chronic kidney disease was preceded by long flu? If it is high, it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;doesn't always mean causality&lt;/a&gt;, but gives pretty good food for thought and helps to better understand relations between different conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important step is data visualisation. Does CKD happens in males more often than in females? What about their place of residence? What is distribution of CKD cases by age? It's hard to grasp large dataset as a set of numbers, plotting them out makes it much easier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you have an idea of what's going on, perform &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hypothesis testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to check your assumption. If you reject null hypothesis (basic assumption) in favour of alternative one, congratulations, you've made &quot;something real&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you have a good understanding of your data, try to create complete &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt;.

Therefore, I think that you can solve this issue in at least several ways, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Convert data&lt;/strong&gt; to correct type &lt;strong&gt;during import&lt;/strong&gt;. To do this, just use the following options of &lt;code&gt;read.csv()&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;stringsAsFactors&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;as.is&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;colClasses&lt;/code&gt;.

First, if you have a single Date column, you can use &lt;code&gt;as.Date.character()&lt;/code&gt; to pass the desired format to &lt;code&gt;colClasses&lt;/code&gt;. Second, if you have multiple Date columns, you can write a function for that and pass it to &lt;code&gt;colClasses&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;setAs()&lt;/code&gt;.

In expectation, at least, the distribution of features in your sample must match the distribution of features in the population. When you are fitting a model with a response variable, &lt;em&gt;this includes features that you do not observe, but that affect any response variables in your model&lt;/em&gt;. Since it is, in many cases, impossible to know what you do not observe, &lt;strong&gt;random sampling&lt;/strong&gt; is used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea with randomization is that a random sample, up to sampling error, &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; accurately reflect the distribution of all features in the population, observed and otherwise. This is why &lt;strong&gt;randomization is the &quot;gold standard,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; but if sample control is available by some other technique, or it is defensible to argue that there are no omitted features, then it isn't always necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your sample must be &lt;strong&gt;large enough&lt;/strong&gt; that the effect of &lt;strong&gt;sampling error&lt;/strong&gt; on the feature distribution is relatively small. This is, again, to ensure representativeness. But deciding who to sample is different from deciding how many people to sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since it sounds like you're fitting a model, there's the additional consideration that certain important combinations of features could be relatively rare in the population. This is not an issue for generalizability, but it bears heavily on your considerations for sample size. For instance, I'm working on a project now with (non-big) data that was originally collected to understand the experiences of minorities in college. As such, it was critically important to ensure that &lt;strong&gt;statistical power&lt;/strong&gt; was high &lt;em&gt;specifically in the minority subpopulation&lt;/em&gt;. For this reason, blacks and Latinos were deliberately &lt;strong&gt;oversampled&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the proportion by which they were oversampled was also recorded. These are used to compute survey weights. These can be used to  re-weight the sample so as to reflect the estimated population proportions, in the event that a representative sample is required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An additional consideration arises if your model is hierarchical. A canonical use for a hierarchical model is one of children's behavior in schools. Children are &quot;grouped&quot; by school and share school-level traits. Therefore a representative sample of schools is required, and within each school a representative sample of children is required. This leads to &lt;strong&gt;stratified sampling&lt;/strong&gt;. This and some other sampling designs are reviewed in surprising depth on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1156" LastActivityDate="2014-08-05T12:58:16.000" CommentCount="1" />

You can run such a regression using R without any special efforts for sparse data. Just use the &lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt; command (for &quot;linear model&quot;). Use &lt;code&gt;?lm&lt;/code&gt; to see the help page. And note that &lt;code&gt;lm&lt;/code&gt; will by default silently add a constant column of ones to your design matrix (the intercept) - include a &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; on the right hand side of your formula to suppress this. Overall, assuming all your data (and nothing else) is in a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;model &amp;lt;- lm(y~.-1,data=foo)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then you can look at parameter estimates etc. like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(model)&#xA;residuals(model)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; your system is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; larger, say on the order of 10,000 observations and hundreds of predictors, looking at specialized sparse solvers as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2853&quot;&gt;Aleksandr's answer&lt;/a&gt; may start to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in your comment to &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2853&quot;&gt;Aleksandr's answer&lt;/a&gt;, you mention constraints on your equation.

In Java an exception can have several causing exceptions, and the whole must be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, given the following example exception:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.myapp.CustomException: Error printing ...&#xA;... (stack)&#xA;Caused by: com.foo.webservice.RemoteException: Unable to communicate ...&#xA;... (stack)&#xA;Caused by: com.acme.PrintException: PrintServer002: Timeout ....&#xA;... (stack)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, our algorithm splits the whole stack in three isolated exceptions. Afterwards it starts analyzing these exceptions starting from the most inner one. In this case, it determines that this exception (the second caused by) is of type &lt;code&gt;Availability&lt;/code&gt; and that the responsible component is a &quot;print server&quot;. This is because there is a rule that matches containing the word &lt;code&gt;Timeout&lt;/code&gt; associated to the &lt;code&gt;Availability&lt;/code&gt; type. There is also a rule that matches &lt;code&gt;com.acme.PrintException&lt;/code&gt; and determines that the responsible component is a print server. As all the information needed is determined using only the most inner exception, the upper exceptions are ignored, but this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see this kind of approximation is very complex (and chaotic) as a human have to create new rules as new exceptions appear. Besides, the new rules have to be compatible with the current ones because a new rule for classifying a new exception must not change the classification of any of the already classified exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are thinking about using Machine Learning to automate this process.

Predicted variable is just what you want to know, i.e. in your case it is exception type. Features are more tricky. You cannot just throw raw text into an algorithm, you need to extract meaningful parts of it and organize them as feature vectors first. You've already mentioned a couple of useful features - exception class name (e.g. &lt;code&gt;com.acme.PrintException&lt;/code&gt;) and contained words (&quot;Timeout&quot;). All you need is to translate your row exceptions (and human-categorized exception types) into suitable dataset, e.g.: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ex_class                  contains_timeout  ...   | ex_type&#xA;-----------------------------------------------------------&#xA;[com.acme.PrintException, 1                , ...] | Availability&#xA;[java.lang.Exception    , 0                , ...] | Network&#xA; ...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This representation is already much better for ML algorithms. But which one to take? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking into account nature of the task and your current approach natural choice is to use &lt;strong&gt;decision trees&lt;/strong&gt;. This class of algorithms will compute optimal decision criteria for all your exception types and print out resulting tree. This is especially useful, because you will have possibility to manually inspect how decision is made and see how much it corresponds to your manually-crafted rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's, however, possibility that some exceptions with exactly the same features will belong to different exception types. In this case probabilistic approach may work well. Despite its name, &lt;strong&gt;Naive Bayes&lt;/strong&gt; classifier works pretty well in most cases. There's one issue with NB and our dataset representation, though: dataset contains &lt;em&gt;categorical&lt;/em&gt; variables, and Naive Bayes can work with &lt;em&gt;numerical&lt;/em&gt; attributes only*. Standard way to overcome this problem is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_%28statistics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dummy variables&lt;/a&gt;. In short, dummy variables are binary variables that simply indicate whether specific category presents or not. For example, single variable &lt;code&gt;ex_class&lt;/code&gt; with values &lt;code&gt;{com.acme.PrintException, java.lang.Exception, ...}&lt;/code&gt;, etc. may be split into several variables &lt;code&gt;ex_class_printexception&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ex_class_exception&lt;/code&gt;, etc. with values &lt;code&gt;{0, 1}&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ex_class_printexception  ex_class_exception  contains_timeout | ex_type&#xA;-----------------------------------------------------------------------&#xA;[1,                    , 0                 , 1              ] | Availability&#xA;[0,                    , 1                 , 0              ] | Network&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last algorithm to try is &lt;strong&gt;Support Vector Machines (SVM)&lt;/strong&gt;.

MongoDB is neither fast with this type of data, nor provide any advanced tools for analysis (correct me if you know any). So I can think of a very few applications for Mongo in data mining. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadoop&lt;/strong&gt; is a large ecosystem, containing dozens of different tools. I will assume that you mean core Hadoop features - HDFS and MapReduce. HDFS provides flexible way to store large amounts of data, while MapReduce gives basis for processing them. It has its clear advantages for processing multi-terabyte datasets, but it also has significant drawbacks. In particular, because of intensive disk IO during MapReduce tasks (that slows down computations a lot) it is terrible for interactive development, iterative algorithms and working with not-that-big datasets. For more details see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/863/1279&quot;&gt;earlier answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many algorithms in Hadoop require multiple MapReduce jobs with complicated data flow. This is where &lt;strong&gt;Scalding&lt;/strong&gt; gets shiny. Scalding (and underlying Java's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cascading.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cascading&lt;/a&gt;) provides much simpler API, but at the moment uses same MapReduce as its runtime and thus holds all the same issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark&lt;/strong&gt; addresses exactly these issues. It drops Hadoop's MapReduce and offers completely new computational framework based on distributed in-memory collections and delayed evaluations. Its API is somewhat similar to Scalding's with all MR complexity removed, so it's really easy to get started with it. Spark is also the first in this list that comes with data mining library - &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MLlib&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Spark doesn't reinvent things like basic linear algebra. For this purpose it uses &lt;strong&gt;Breeze&lt;/strong&gt;. To my opinion, Breeze is far in quality from scientific packages like SciPy, Octave or Julia, but it is still good enough for most practical use cases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahout&lt;/strong&gt; relies on Hadoop's MapReduce and thus is terrible for iterative algorithms. &lt;strong&gt;Spire&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Saddle&lt;/strong&gt; look cute and probably have their niche, but seem to be much less well-known than Breeze. I couldn't find much information about &lt;strong&gt;H2O&lt;/strong&gt;, so it doesn't look like a big player here (comments from people who used it are welcome).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some quick summary. Spark seems to be the most simple, flexible and fast-growing project for large-scale data processing. It facilitates a number of new projects (e.g. Shark or Spark SQL) and penetrates into existing (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.concurrentinc.com/2014/05/cascading-now-supports-tez-spark-and-storm-up-next/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cascading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mahout.apache.org/users/sparkbindings/home.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mahout&lt;/a&gt;). Spark knows how to utilize HDFS API, and thus scales to terabytes of data easily. And for data mining downshifters who don't want to bother with a cluster setup there's always pure Breeze. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastEditorUserId="1279" LastEditDate="2014-08-09T21:25:58.250" LastActivityDate="2014-08-09T21:25:58.250" CommentCount="0" />

You have to provide more details. If you're dealing with &lt;strong&gt;bid data&lt;/strong&gt;, then this fact will most likely affect selection of preferred &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;approaches&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;algorithms&lt;/em&gt; for your &lt;strong&gt;data analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. I hope that the following thoughts of mine on data analysis address your sub-questions. Please note that the numbering of my points does not match the numbering of your sub-questions. However, I believe that it better reflects general &lt;strong&gt;data analysis workflow&lt;/strong&gt;, at least, how I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Firstly, I think that you need to have at least some kind of &lt;strong&gt;conceptual model&lt;/strong&gt; in mind (or, better, on paper). This model should guide you in your &lt;em&gt;exploratory data analysis (EDA)&lt;/em&gt;. A presence of a &lt;em&gt;dependent variable (DV)&lt;/em&gt; in the model means that in your &lt;em&gt;machine learning (ML)&lt;/em&gt; phase later in the analysis you will deal with so called supervised ML, as opposed to unsupervised ML in the absence of an identified DV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Secondly, &lt;strong&gt;EDA&lt;/strong&gt; is a crucial part. IMHO, EDA should include &lt;strong&gt;multiple iterations&lt;/strong&gt; of producing &lt;em&gt;descriptive statistics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;data visualization&lt;/em&gt;, as you refine your understanding about the data. Not only this phase will give you valuable insights about your datasets, but it will feed your next important phase - &lt;strong&gt;data cleaning and transformation&lt;/strong&gt;. Just throwing your raw data into a statistical software package won't give much - for any &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt; statistical analysis, data should be &lt;em&gt;clean, correct and consistent&lt;/em&gt;. This is often the most time- and effort-consuming, but absolutely necessary part. For more details on this topic, read these nice papers: &lt;a href=&quot;http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (by Hadley Wickham) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Now, as you're hopefully done with &lt;em&gt;EDA&lt;/em&gt; as well as data cleaning and transformation, your ready to start some more statistically-involved phases. One of such phases is &lt;em&gt;exploratory factor analysis (EFA)&lt;/em&gt;, which will allow you to extract the underlying &lt;strong&gt;structure&lt;/strong&gt; of your data. For datasets with large number of variables, the positive side effect of EFA is &lt;em&gt;dimensionality reduction&lt;/em&gt;. And, while in that sense EFA is similar to &lt;em&gt;principal components analysis (PCA)&lt;/em&gt; and other dimensionality reduction approaches, I think that EFA is more important as it allows to refine your conceptual model of the phenomena that your data &quot;describe&quot;, thus making sense of your datasets. Of course, in addition to EFA, you can/should perform &lt;strong&gt;regression analysis&lt;/strong&gt; as well as apply &lt;strong&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/strong&gt;, based on your findings in previous phases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a note on &lt;strong&gt;software tools&lt;/strong&gt;. In my opinion, current state of statistical software packages is at such point that practically any major software packages have comparable offerings feature-wise. If you study or work in an organization that have certain policies and preferences in term of software tools, then you are &lt;em&gt;constrained&lt;/em&gt; by them. However, if that is not the case, I would heartily recommend &lt;strong&gt;open source&lt;/strong&gt; statistical software, based on your comfort with its specific &lt;em&gt;programming language&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;learning curve&lt;/em&gt; and your &lt;em&gt;career perspectives&lt;/em&gt;. My current platform of choice is &lt;strong&gt;R Project&lt;/strong&gt;, which offers mature, powerful, flexible, extensive and open statistical software, along with amazing ecosystem of packages, experts and enthusiasts. Other nice choices include &lt;em&gt;Python&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Julia&lt;/em&gt; and specific open source software for processing &lt;strong&gt;big data&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;em&gt;Hadoop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spark&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NoSQL&lt;/em&gt; databases, &lt;em&gt;WEKA&lt;/em&gt;.

Basically you need to estimate the respective class means and class covariances.  Now the first thing you care about is your estimate of the difference in the class means: but your performance is limited by the accuracy of the worst estimated mean: its no good estimating one mean to the 100th decimal place - if the other mean is only estimated to 1 decimal place.  So its a waste of computing resources to use all the data - you can instead undersample the  more common class AND reweight the classes appropriately. ( those computing resources can then be used exploring different input variables etc)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the second issue is predictive accuracy: different algorithms use different error metrics, which may or may not agree with your own objectives. eg logistic regression will penalise overall probability error,  so if  most of your data is from one class, then it will tend to try to improve accurate probability estimates ( eg 90 vs 95% probability) of that one class rather than trying to identify the rare class. in that case you would definitely want to try to reweight to emphasize the rare class ( and subsequently adjust the estimate [by adjusting the bias term] to get the probability estimates realigned)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1256" LastActivityDate="2014-08-23T14:15:58.660" CommentCount="0" />

There are numerical issues with multiplying many small numbers(imagine if you had millions of samples you had to multiply millions of small numbers for the lhd). Also taking gradients for optimization methods that require gradients is often easier when you are dealing with the log likelihood. In general, it is good to have an objective which is a sum rather than a product of variables when dealing with optimization problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, fmin is using Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm which has no convergence guarantees according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin.html#scipy.optimize.fmin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;scipy documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This means the convergence is totally random and you should not expect to find parameters close to the originals. To get around this, I would suggest you to use a gradient based method like stochastic gradient descent or BFGS. Since you know the generative model (rvs are Gaussian distributed) you can write the likelihood and log likelihood as:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfsvr.png&quot; alt=&quot;equations&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where a,b,c and d are your model parameters 5,2,3 and 4 respectively.&#xA;Then take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gradient&lt;/a&gt; with respect to [a,b,c,d] and feed that into prime input of fmin_bfgs.

If the results of an unsupervized learning algorithm are fed to a supervized learning algorithm, the net result is unsupervized --- there are still no grown-ups in the room. And the classification errors of the resulting process will contain error terms from both stages. You won't get the same performance as you would if you did a SVM with properly tagged training data. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use the method you propose ... it might still work well ... but it won't be a supervized learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3077" LastEditorUserId="3077" LastEditDate="2014-08-29T19:26:39.963" LastActivityDate="2014-08-29T19:26:39.963" CommentCount="0" />

But at the very heart, they will use some form of an &lt;strong&gt;inverted index&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; search several terabytes when you enter a search query (even when it is not cached). They likely don't look at the actual documents at all. But they use a lookup table that lists which documents match your query term (with stemming, misspellings, synonyms etc. all preprocessed). They probably retrieve the &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of the top 10000 documents for each word (10k integers - just a few kb!) and compute the best matches from that. Only if there aren't good matches in these lists, they expand to the next such blocks etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Queries for common words can be easily cached; and via preprocessing you can build a list of the top 10k results and then rerank them according to the user profile. There is nothing to be gained by computing an &quot;exact&quot; answer, too. Looking at the top 10k results is likely enough; there is no correct answer; and if a better result somewhere at position 10001 is missed, nobody will know or notice (or care).

It's easy to implement, and easy to reuse in very different domains. You'll find hundreds of APRIORI implementations of varying quality. And it's easy to get APRIORI wrong, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FPgrowth is much harder to implement, but also much more interesting. So from an academic point of view, everybody tries to improve FPgrowth - getting work based on APRIORI accepted will be very hard by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a good implementation, every algorithm has it's good and it's bad situations in my opinion. A good APRIORI implementation will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; need to scan the database &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; times to find all frequent itemsets of length &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;. In particular if your data fits into main memory this is cheap. What can kill APRIORI is too many frequent 2-itemsets (in particular when you don't use a Trie and similar acceleration techniques etc.). It works best on large data with a low number of frequent itemsets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eclat works on columns; but it needs to read each column much more often. There is some work on diffsets to reduce this work. If your data does not fit into main memory, Eclat suffers probably more than Apriori. By going depth first, it will also be able to return a first interesting result much earlier than Apriori, and you can use these results to adjust parameters; so you need less iterations to find good parameters. But by design, it cannot exploit pruning as neatly as Apriori did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FPGrowth compresses the data set into the tree. This works best when you have lots of duplicate records. You could probably reap of quite some gains for Apriori and Eclat too if you can presort your data and merge duplicates into weighted vectors. FPGrowth does this at an extreme level. The drawback is that the implementation is much harder; and once this tree does not fit into memory anymore it gets a mess to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for performance results and benchmarks - don't trust them. There are so many things to implement incorrectly. Try 10 different implementations, and you get 10 very different performance results.

Classification (also known as categorization) is an example of &lt;strong&gt;supervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;. In supervised learning you have: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt; - something that approximates internal structure in your data, enabling you to reason about it and make useful predictions (e.g. predict class of an object); normally model has parameters that you want to &quot;learn&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;training&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;testing datasets&lt;/strong&gt; - sets of objects that you use for training your model (finding good values for parameters) and further evaluating &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;training&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;classification algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; - first describes how to learn model from training dataset, second shows how to derive class of a new object given trained model&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's take a simple case of spam classification. Your training dataset is a corpus of emails + corresponding labels - &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not spam&quot;. Testing dataset has the same structure, but made from some independent emails (normally one just splits his dataset and makes, say, 9/10 of it to be used for training and 1/10 - for testing). One way to model emails is to represent each of them as a set (bag) of words. If we assume that words are independent of each other, we can use &lt;strong&gt;Naive Bayes classifier&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, calculate prior probabilities for each word and each class (training algorithm) and then apply Bayes theorem to find posterior probability of a new document to belong to particular class. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, basically we have: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;raw model + training set + training algorithm -&amp;gt; trained model&#xA;trained model + classification algorithm + new object -&amp;gt; object label&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now note that we represented our objects (documents) as a bag of words. But is the only way? In fact, we can extract much more from raw text. For example, instead of words as is we can use their &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html&quot;&gt;stems or lemmas&lt;/a&gt;, throw out noisy &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words&quot;&gt;stop words&lt;/a&gt;, add &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml&quot;&gt;POS tags&lt;/a&gt; of words, extract &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml&quot;&gt;named entities&lt;/a&gt; or even explore HTML structure of the document. In fact, more general representation of a document (and, in general, any object) is a &lt;strong&gt;feature vector&lt;/strong&gt;. E.g. for text: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;actor, analogue, bad, burn, ..., NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ..., in_bold, ... | label&#xA;    0,        0,   1,    1, ...,    5,    7,   2, ...,       2, ... | not spam&#xA;    0,        1,   0,    0, ...,    3,   12,  10, ...,       0, ... | spam&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here first row is a list of possible features and subsequent rows show how many times that feature occurs in a document. E.g. in first document there's no occurrences of word &quot;actor&quot;, 1 occurrence of word &quot;burn&quot;, 5 nouns, 2 adjectives and 2 pieces of text in bold. Last column corresponds to a resulting class label. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using feature vector you can incorporate any properties of your texts. Though finding good set of features may take some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And what about model and algorithms? Are we bound to Naive Bayes. Not at all. &lt;strong&gt;logistic regression&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SVM&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;decision trees&lt;/strong&gt; - just to mention few popular classifiers. (Note, that we say &quot;classifier&quot; in most cases we mean model + corresponding algorithms for training and classification). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for implementation, you can divide task into 2 parts: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Features extraction - transforming raw texts into feature vectors. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Object classification - building and applying model.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First point is well worked out in many &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4115526/natural-language-processing&quot;&gt;NLP libraries&lt;/a&gt;.

If I now added an intercept feature, which would accord to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;phi = [1, 1; 1, 0; 1, 1; 1, 1];&#xA;w = [1; 1];&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;my R-matrix becomes singular and the last weights value is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;w  =&#xA;  - 5.8151677  &#xA;  1.290D+30  &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which - to my reading - would mean, that the probability of belonging to class 1 would be close to 1 if feature 1 is present about 3% for the rest. There has got to be any error I made, but I do not get which one. For both implementations yield the same results I suspect that there is some point I've been missing or gotten wrong, but I do not understand which one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3283" LastActivityDate="2014-09-23T02:20:24.670" Title="Logistic Regression implementation does not converge" Tags="&lt;logistic-regression&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="3" FavoriteCount="1" />

First of all, it's worth to &lt;strong&gt;visualize&lt;/strong&gt; your data. I will pretend I have following data: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/KciVJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;number of words vs. age&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we see slight dependency between age and number of words in responses. We may assume that young people (approx. between 12 and 25) tend to use 1-4 words, while people of age 25-35 try to give longer answers. But how do we split these points? I would do it something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uect9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2D plot it looks pretty straightforward, and this is how it works most of the time in practise. However, you asked for splitting data by a single variable - age. That is, something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/G10GI.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it a good split? I don't know. In fact, it depends on your actual needs and interpretation of the &quot;cut points&quot;. That's why I asked about &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt; task. Anyway, this interpretation is up to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practise, you will have much more text-based variables. E.g. you can use every word as a feature (don't forget to &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stem or lemmatize&lt;/a&gt; it first) with values from zero to a number of occurrences in the response. Visualizing high-dimensional data is not an easy task, so you need a way to discover groups of data without plotting them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clustering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a general approach for this. Though clustering algorithms may work with data of arbitrary dimensionality, we still have only 2D to plot it, so let's come back to our example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With algorithm like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;k-means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you can obtain 2 groups like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tp4aK.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two dots - red and blue - show cluster centres, calculated by k-means. You can use coordinates of these points to split your data by any subset of axes, even if you have 10k dimensions. But again, the most important question here is: &lt;em&gt;what linguistic features will provide reasonable grouping of ages&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-09-19T22:51:43.883" CommentCount="0" />

With 8 variables (columns) your space is already low-dimensional, reducing number of variables further is unlikely to solve technical issues with memory size, but may affect dataset quality a lot. In you concrete case it's more promising to take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;online learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; methods. Roughly speaking, instead of working with the whole dataset, these methods take a little part of them (often referred to as &quot;mini-batches&quot;) at a time and build a model incrementally. (I personally like to interpret word &quot;online&quot; as a reference to some infinitely long source of data from Internet like Twitter feed, where you just can't load the whole dataset at once). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what if you really wanted to apply dimensionality reduction technique like PCA to a dataset that doesn't fit into a memory? Normally dataset is represented as a data matrix &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; of size &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is number of observations (rows) and &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is a number of variables (columns). Typically problem with memory comes from only one of these two numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Too many observations (n &gt;&gt; m)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you have &lt;strong&gt;too many observations&lt;/strong&gt;, but number of variables is from small to moderate, you can &lt;strong&gt;build covariance matrix incrementally&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, typical PCA consists of constructing covariance matrix of size &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; and applying singular value decomposition to it. With &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;=1000 variables of type float64 covariance matrix has size 1000*1000*8 ~ 8Mb, which easily fits into memory and may be used with SVD. So you need only to build covariance matrix without loading entire dataset into memory - &lt;a href=&quot;http://rebcabin.github.io/blog/2013/01/22/covariance-matrices/&quot;&gt;pretty tractable task&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can select small representative sample from your dataset and &lt;strong&gt;approximate covariance matrix&lt;/strong&gt;. This matrix will have all the same properties as normal, just a little bit less accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Too many variables (n &amp;lt;&amp;lt; m)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On another hand, sometimes, when you have &lt;strong&gt;too many variables&lt;/strong&gt;, covariance matrix itself will not fit into memory. E.g. if you work with 640x480 images, every observation has 640*480=307200 variables, which results in 703Gb covariance matrix! That's definitely not what you would like to keep in memory of your computer. Or even in memory of your cluster. So we need to reduce dimensions without building covariance matrix at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My favourite method for doing it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/Ping/KDD06_rp.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random Projection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In short, if you have dataset &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; of size &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;, you can multiply it by some sparse random matrix &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; of size &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; (with &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;) and obtain new matrix &lt;em&gt;X'&lt;/em&gt; of a much smaller size &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;approximately same properties&lt;/em&gt; as original one. Why it works? Well, you should know that PCA aims to find set of orthogonal axes (principal components) and project your data onto first &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; of them. It turns out, that sparse random vectors are &lt;em&gt;nearly orthogonal&lt;/em&gt; and thus may also be used as a new basis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, you don't have to multiply the whole dataset &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; - you can translate every observation &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; into new basis separately or in mini-batches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also somewhat similar algorithm called &lt;strong&gt;Random SVD&lt;/strong&gt;.

Therefore weightings of the form $\sum_i w_i e_i$ are equivalent to duplicating the data w_i times (eg for w_i integer). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One simple case is if you have repeated data - rather than keeping all the duplicated data points, you just &quot;weight&quot; your one repeated sample by the number of instances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now whilst this is easy to do in a batch setting, it is hard in vowpal wabbits online big data setting: given that you have a large data set, you do not just want to represent the data n times to deal with the weighting ( because it increases your computational load). Similarly, just multiplying the gradient vector by the weighting - which is correct in batch gradient descent - will cause big problems for stochastic/online gradient descent: essentially you shoot off in one direction ( think of large integer weights) then you shoot off in the other - causing significant instability. SGD essentially relies on all the errors to be of roughly the same order ( so that the learning rate can be set appropriately). So what they propose is to ensure that the update for training sample x_i with weight n is equivalent to presenting training sample x_i n times consecutively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea being that presenting it consecutively reduces the problem because the error gradient (for that single example $x_i$) reduces for each consecutive presentation and update (as you get closer &amp;amp; closer to the minimum for that specific example). In other words the consecutive updates provides a kind of feedback control. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me it sounds like you would still have instabilities (you get to zero error on x_i, then you get to zero error on x_i+1,...). the learning rate will need to be adjusted to take into account the size of the weights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1256" LastActivityDate="2014-09-29T00:20:24.093" CommentCount="13" />

When I tried doing this I got poor clustering results when compared with simple hierarchical clustering. Items that weren't very similar were being bucketed together in one dimension, while there were available dimensions that weren't used. The results weren't completely random, but they were definitely worse than the output from the hierarchical clustering. I attempted the SVD step with Mahaut and Octave and the results were similar. For the hierarchical clustering I used the Jaccard measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point I am starting to doubt the notion of SVD as a way to reduce dimensionality. Do you think that SVD cannot be used effectively in this case (and why?) or do you think that I made some mistake along the way?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3506" LastEditorUserId="84" LastEditDate="2014-10-02T12:36:46.010" LastActivityDate="2014-10-02T12:36:46.010" Title="Using SVD for clustering" Tags="&lt;clustering&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="14" />

Therefore, using vector operations can remarkably decrease computation time. Coming up with a vectorized implementation of batch gradient descent is quite straightforward. However, in the case of stochastic gradient descent I can not figure out how to avoid the outer loop that iterates through all the samples at each epoch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does anybody know any vectorized implementation of stochastic gradient descent? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: I've been asked why would I like to use online gradient descent if the size of my dataset is fixed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From [1], one can see that online gradient descent converges slower than batch gradient descent to the minimum of the empirical cost. However, it converges faster to the minimum of the expected cost, which measures generalization performance. I'd like to test the impact of these theoretical results in my particular problem, by means of cross validation.

For predicting continuous variables there's nothing more basic than &lt;strong&gt;simple linear regression&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Simple&quot; in the name means that there's only one predictor variable used (+ intercept, of course): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;y = b0 + x*b1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;b0&lt;/code&gt; is an intercept and &lt;code&gt;b1&lt;/code&gt; is a slope. For example, you may want to predict lemonade consumption in a park based on temperature:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cons = b0 + temp * b1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature is in well-defined &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;/strong&gt; variable. But if we talk about something more abstract like &quot;weather&quot;, then it's harder to understand how we measure and encode it. It's ok if we say that the weather takes values &lt;code&gt;{terrible, bad, normal, good, excellent}&lt;/code&gt; and assign values numbers from -2 to +2 (implying that &quot;excellent&quot; weather is twice as good as &quot;good&quot;). But what if the weather is given by words &lt;code&gt;{shiny, rainy, cool, ...}&lt;/code&gt;? We can't give an order to these variables. We call such variables &lt;strong&gt;categorical&lt;/strong&gt;. Since there's no natural order between different categories, we can't encode them as a single numerical variable (and linear regression expects numbers only), but we can use so-called &lt;strong&gt;dummy encoding&lt;/strong&gt;:  instead of a single variable &lt;code&gt;weather&lt;/code&gt; we use 3 variables - &lt;code&gt;[weather_shiny, weather_rainy, weather_cool]&lt;/code&gt;, only one of which can take value 1, and others should take value 0. In fact, we will have to drop one variable because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;collinearity&lt;/a&gt;. So model for predicting traffic from weather may look like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;traffic = b0 + weather_shiny * b1 + weather_rainy * b2  # weather_cool dropped&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where either &lt;code&gt;b1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;b2&lt;/code&gt; is 1, or both are 0. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that you can also encounter non-linear dependency between predictor and predicted variables (you can easily check it by plotting &lt;code&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; pairs). Simplest way to deal with it without refusing linear model is to use polynomial features - simply add polynomials of your feature as new features.

I have not encountered it before so here is a solution I just made up, inspired by the approach taken by the word2vec paper:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define the pair-wise similarity based on the longest common substring (LCS), or the LCS normalized by the products of the string lengths. Cache this in a matrix for any pair of strings considered since it is expensive to calculate. Also consider approximations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a Euclidean (hyperspherical, perhaps?) embedding that minimizes the error (Euclidean distance if using the ball, and the dot product if using the sphere). Assume random initialization, and use a gradient-based optimization method by taking the Jacobian of the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you have a Hilbert space embedding, so cluster using your algorithm of choice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Response to deleted comment asking how to cluster multiple substrings&lt;/em&gt;: The bulk of the complexity lies in the first stage; the calculation of the LCS, so it depends on efficiently you do that. I've had luck with genetic algorithms. Anyway, what you'd do in this case is define a similarity &lt;em&gt;vector&lt;/em&gt; rather than a scalar, whose elements are the k-longest pair-wise LCS; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8361/algorithm-find-the-first-k-longest-substrings-between-two-similar-strings&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; discussion for algorithms. Then I would define the error by the sum of the errors corresponding to each substring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something I did not address is how to choose the dimensionality of the embedding. The word2vec paper might provide some heuristics; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/word2vec-toolkit/HRvNPIqe6mM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; discussion. I recall they used pretty big spaces, on the order of a 1000 dimensions, but they were optimizing something more complicated, so I suggest you start at R^2 and work your way up. Of course, you will want to use a higher dimensionality for the multiple LCS case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastEditorUserId="381" LastEditDate="2014-10-24T18:35:41.350" LastActivityDate="2014-10-24T18:35:41.350" CommentCount="0" />

If you are analyzing &lt;em&gt;height&lt;/em&gt; of people, you could use &lt;em&gt;course-grained variables&lt;/em&gt; that have only a few possible values -- e.g. &quot;above-average, average, below-average&quot; -- or a &lt;em&gt;fine-grained variable&lt;/em&gt;, with many or an infinite number of values -- e.g. integer values or real number values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A measure is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;fuzzy&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; if the distinction between alternative values is not crisp.  In the course-grained variable for &lt;em&gt;height&lt;/em&gt;, a &quot;crisp&quot; measure would mean that any given individual could &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be assigned one value -- e.g. a tall-ish person is either &quot;above-average&quot;, or &quot;average&quot;.  In contrast, a &quot;fuzzy&quot; measure allows for &lt;em&gt;degrees of membership&lt;/em&gt; for each value, with &quot;membership&quot; taking values from 0 to 1.0.  Thus, a tall-ish person could be a value of &quot;0.5 above-average&quot;, &quot;0.5 average&quot;, &quot;0.0 below-average&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a measure is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;rough&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; when two values are given: upper and lower bounds as an estimate of the &quot;crisp&quot; measure.

If you ask married couples to rate the quality of their marriage on a scale from 1 to 10, or 1.00 to 10.00, they might give you a number (or range of numbers), but how reliable are those reports? Using a course-grained measure (e.g. &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;neutral/mixed&quot;, &quot;unhappy&quot;), or fuzzy measure, or rough measure can be more reliable and more credible in your analysis.  Generally, it's much better to use rough/crude measures well than to use precise/fine-grained measures poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="609" LastActivityDate="2014-10-26T19:36:07.113" CommentCount="0" />

Sometimes, its importance relies on the fact that it allows you to carry on with what you are doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, you usually need column independence (independent variables between predictors) because multiple regression will behave badly with highly correlated variables. Even worst, when some of your columns (or rows) are dependent, your matrix is not invertible. Why? Because matrix inversion A^-1 involves the determinant 1/|A|, which is 0 when columns or rows are linearly dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eigenvalues is a common occurrence in calculations related to maximization/minimization in machine learning. Let's say you are interested in principal component analysis. A very important idea there is dimensional reduction (you have a dataset with many variables and want to reduce the number of variables without losing too much explanatory power.) One solution is to project your data onto a lower dimensional space (e.g. taking your data with 50 variables and reducing them to 5 variables.) Turns out a good projection to use is one that includes as much variation as possible and maximization of this variation results in the eigenvalue equation S u  = λ u. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other cases, you explicitly include the eigenvalue equation of some quantity of interest because in doing so, you're changing the coordinate system in which you represent the variables. Take the case of a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution in which the argument of the exponent is given by Δ = (x-μ)^T Σ (x-μ). If you consider the eigenvalue equation of Σ, the exponent can be written as Δ = y_1^2 / λ_1 + y_2^2 / λ_2 (in two dimensions) This is the equation of an ellipse only if λ_1 and λ_2 are positive. Therefore, you obtain the following graphical interpretation (Bishop, PRML, p.81):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/pNrLb.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Positive semi-definite matrices are used as a matter of convenience.

If you're interested in classifying each instance in your dataset into more than one class, then this brings up a set of new concerns regarding setting up your data set, the experiments you want to run, and how you plan to evaluate your classifier(s). My hunch is that you could formulate your task as a binary one where you train and test one classifier for each class you want to predict, and simply set up the data matrix so that there are two classes to predict - (1) the one you're interested in classifying and (2) everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that case, instead of your training set looking like this (where each row is a document and columns 1-3 contain features for that document, and the class column is the class to be predicted): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1           2           3           class&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    law&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    president&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it would look like the following in the case where you're interested in detecting the politics class against everything else:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1           2           3           class&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    non-politics&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    non-politics&#xA;feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You would need to do this process for each class you're interested in predicting, and then train and test one classifier per class and evaluate each classifier according to your chosen metrics (usually accuracy, precision, or recall or some variation thereof).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as choosing features, this requires quite a bit of thinking. Features can be highly dependent on the type of text you're trying to classify, so be sure to explore your dataset and get a sense for how people are writing in each domain. Qualitative investigation isn't enough to decide once and for all what are good features, but it is a good way to get ideas. Also, look into &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TF-IDF&lt;/a&gt; weighting of terms instead of just using their frequency within each instance of your dataset. This will help you pick up on (a) terms that are prevalent within a document (and possibly a target class) and (b) terms that distinguish a given document from other documents.

As you write, you could bucketize your data (say into days), but as you also write, you would lose information. In addition, you may end up with missing values, so you would need to impute, since ARIMA is not very good at handling missing values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One alternative, as you again write, is to feed time dummies into a regression framework. I personally do not really like categorical dummies, because this implies a sharp cutoff between neighboring categories. This is usually not very natural. So I would rather look at periodic splines with different periodicities. This approach has the advantage of dealing with your uneven sampling and also with missing values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; careful about interpreting $R^2$.

I would argue that this disconnect between in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecast accuracy also means that there is no connection between in-sample fit and how well a model &quot;understood&quot; the data, even if your interest lies not in forecasting, but only in modeling per se. My philosophy is that if you can't forecast a time series well, you haven't understood it in any meaningful sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don't overdo the modeling.

This is because the training model used my NLTK probably does not have enough data to recognize Obama as a PERSON. So, one way would be to update this model by training a new model with a lot of labeled training data. Generating labeled training data is one of the most expensive tasks in NLP - because of all the man hours it takes to tag sentences with the correct Part of Speech as well as semantic role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sentence 2, there are 2 concepts - &quot;Former Vice President&quot;, and &quot;Dick Cheney&quot;. You can use co-reference to identify the relation between the 2 NNPs. Both the NNP are refering to the same entity, and the same entity could be referenced as - &quot;former vice president&quot; as well as &quot;Dick Cheney&quot;. Co-reference is often used to identify the Named entity that pronouns refer to. e.g. &quot;Dick Cheney is the former vice president of USA. He is a Republican&quot;. Here the pronoun &quot;he&quot; refers to &quot;Dick Cheney&quot;, and it should be identified by a co-reference identification tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5021" LastActivityDate="2014-11-12T18:41:33.053" CommentCount="1" />

Big Data is often characterized by the 3 V's: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;volume, &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;velocity, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;variety. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More V's than these 3 have been invented since. I suppose the V's were a catchy way to characterize what is Big Data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as hinted, computational intensity is a perfect reason for using Hadoop (if your algorithm is computationally expensive). And, as hinted, the problem you describe is perfect for Hadoop, especially since it is embarrassingly parallel in nature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is Hadoop a good choice for you? I would argue, yes. Why? Because &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hadoop is open source (compared with proprietary systems which may be expensive and black boxes), &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;your problem lends itself well to the MapReduce paradigm (embarassingly parallel, shared-nothing), &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hadoop is easily scalable with commodity hardware (as opposed to specialized hardware, and you should get linear speed-up in your performance with just throwing hardware at the problem, and you can just spin a cluster as needed on cloud service providers),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hadoop allows multiple client languages (Java is only one of many supported languages),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;there might be a library available already to do your cross-product operation, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you're shipping compute code, not data, around the network (which you should benefit from, and as opposed to other distributed platforms where you are shipping data to compute nodes which is the bottleneck).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note, Hadoop is not a distributed file system (as mentioned, and corrected already). Hadoop is distributed storage and processing platform. The distributed storage component of Hadoop is called the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and the distributed processing component is called MapReduce. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hadoop has now evolved slightly. They keep the HDFS part for distributed storage. But they have a new component called YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which serves to appropriate resources (CPU, RAM) for any compute task (including MapReduce). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the &quot;overhead&quot; part, there is noticeable overhead with starting/stopping a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) per tasks (map tasks, reduce tasks). You can specify for your MapReduce Jobs to reuse JVMs to mitigate this issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If &quot;overhead&quot; is really an issue, look into Apache Spark, which is part of the Hadoop ecosystem, and they are orders of magnitude faster than MapReduce, especially for iterative algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used Hadoop to compute pairwise comparisons (e.g. correlation matrix, similarity matrix) that are O(N^2) (n choose 2) in worst case running time complexity. Imagine computing the correlations between 16,000 variables (16,000 choose 2); Hadoop can easily process and store the results if you have the commodity resources to support the cluster.

By definition, vectorization is a technique for converting operations on one element into operations on a vector of such elements. Thus, no, you cannot process examples one by one and still use vectorization. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can, however, approximate true SGD by using &lt;strong&gt;mini-batches&lt;/strong&gt;. Mini-batch is a small subset of original dataset (say, 100 examples). You calculate error and parameter updates based on mini-batches, but you still iterate over many of them without global optimization, making the process stochastic. So, to make your implementation much faster it's enough to change previous line to: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;batches = split dataset into mini-batches&#xA;for batch in batches: &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and calculate error from batch, not from a single example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though pretty obvious, I should also mention vectorization on per-example level. That is, instead of something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;theta = np.array([...])  # parameter vector&#xA;x = np.array([...])      # example&#xA;y = 0                    # predicted response&#xA;for i in range(len(example)):&#xA;    y += x[i] * theta[i]&#xA;error = (true_y - y) ** 2  # true_y - true value of response&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you should definitely do something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;error = (true_y - sum(np.dot(x, theta))) ** 2&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which, again, easy to generalize for mini-batches:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;true_y = np.array([...])     # vector of response values&#xA;X = np.array([[...], [...]]) # mini-batch&#xA;errors = true_y - sum(np.dot(X, theta), 1)&#xA;error = sum(e ** 2 for e in errors)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-11-21T11:50:47.717" CommentCount="2" />

Now i want my algorithm to be able to cluster the training sets to according to their features, which here is the frequency of each word in the article.

Oryx is based on Apache Mahout (actually one of the creators of Mahout Sean Owen built it) and provides recommendation using collaborative filtering. Oryx is a very practical tool for implementing recommendation. I have used it in several projects: recommending products in retail stores (small businesses), building an e-commerce recommender and user similarity from mobile app interaction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You just have to represent data in the form:&#xA;UserId ItemId Value&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where value is a measure (subjective) of the &lt;em&gt;importance&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;influence&lt;/em&gt; of the interaction between that user and the item. User and item can be anything actually, and the same procedure can be used for tagging.

Maybe this might be an indicator that the programs need to be split further into smaller components&#xA;Folks might be more productive during certain times of day than others - does time of day affect bug introductions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Module Maturity: &#xA;Which Modules have the most number of issues? &#xA;Are they worked upon by more developers or less?&#xA;Do defects keep aging for a long time before they are fixed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these questions will change depending on what you are working on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5182" LastActivityDate="2014-11-26T21:20:52.973" CommentCount="0" />

AUC applies to binary classifiers that have some notion of a decision threshold internally. For example logistic regression returns positive/negative depending on whether the logistic function is greater/smaller than a threshold, usually 0.5 by default. When you choose your threshold, you have a classifier. You have to choose one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a given choice of threshold, you can compute accuracy, which is the proportion of true positives and negatives in the whole data set.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AUC measures how true positive rate (recall) and false positive rate trade off, so in that sense it is already measuring something else. More importantly, AUC is not a function of threshold. It is an evaluation of the classifier as threshold varies over all possible values. It is in a sense a broader metric, testing the quality of the internal value that the classifier generates and then compares to a threshold. It is not testing the quality of a particular choice of threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AUC has a different interpretation, and that is that it's also the probability that a randomly chosen positive example is ranked above a randomly chosen negative example, according to the classifier's internal value for the examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AUC is computable even if you have an algorithm that only produces a ranking on examples. AUC is not computable if you truly only have a black-box classifier, and not one with an internal threshold. These would usually dictate which of the two is even available to a problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AUC is, I think, a more comprehensive measure, although applicable in fewer situations. It's not strictly better than accuracy; it's different. It depends in part on whether you care more about true positives, false negatives, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;F-measure is more like accuracy in the sense that it's a function of a classifier and its threshold setting.

But there are multiple shortcuts, especially if your domain is limited to cameras/electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you should look at more sites. Many have product brand annotated in the page (proper html annotations, bold font, all caps in the beginning of the name). Some sites have entire pages with brand selectors for search purposes. This way you can create a pretty good starter dictionary of brand names. Same with product line names and even with models. Alphanumeric models can be extracted in bulk by regular expressions and filtered pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other tricks, but I'll try to be brief. Just a piece of advice here: there is always a trade-off between manual work and algorithms. Always keep in mind that both approaches can be mixed and both have return-on-invested-time curves, which people tend to forget. If your goal is not to create an automatic algorithm to extract product brands and models, this problem should have limited time budget in your plan. You can realistically create a dictionary of 1000 brands in a day, and for decent performance on known data source of electronic goods (we are not talking Amazon here or are we?) a dictionary of 4000 brands may be all you need for your work.

So, ideally, you do some testing as I described with many algorithms and compare the accuracy, then choose the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, you can also take other factors into account, such as the need to minimize the data set (for performance reasons), and run your tests only with a certain portion of the training data available.

Then, you get to weigh performance VS accuracy VS challenge of implementation (such as deploying on a Hadoop cluster).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, different algorithms are suited for different project. However, there are some general rules:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All algorithms always do better with unreduced data sets (more data is better).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More complex algorithms aren't necessarily better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest starting with a simple algorithm and ensuring you have high quality data.

He or she must also have a solid grasp of math, statistics, and &lt;strong&gt;analytic methodology&lt;/strong&gt;. Data science and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;big data&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; go hand-in-hand, so all data scientists need to be familiar with frameworks for distributed computing. Finally, data scientists must have a basic understanding of the domains in which they operate, as well as excellent communications skills and the ability to &lt;strong&gt;tell a good story with data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With these basics covered, the next step is to develop &lt;strong&gt;deep expertise&lt;/strong&gt; in one or more of the vertical areas. &quot;Data Science&quot; is really an umbrella term for a collection of interrelated techniques and approaches taken from a variety of disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, and software engineering. The goal of these diverse methods is to &lt;strong&gt;extract actionable intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; from data of all kinds, enabling clients to make better &lt;strong&gt;data-driven decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. No one person can ever possibly master all aspects of data science; doing so would require multiple lifetimes of training and experience. The best data scientists are therefore &quot;&lt;strong&gt;T-shaped&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; individuals -- that is, they possess a breadth of knowledge across all areas of data science, along with deep expertise in at least one.

The “Premium&#xA;  1000” series is made with a high quality, supersensitive&#xA;  emulsion. It is nationally marketed in roll form for&#xA;  amateurs and sheet and film-pack forms for&#xA;  professionals. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Roll film is similar to most film commonly used by the&#xA;  general public. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Sheet film is handled in total darkness, negatives being&#xA;  withdrawn from between interleaf papers by the&#xA;  photographer and inserted into a light-tight holder&#xA;  which is then placed in the camera. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Film-pack is a self-contained unit ready to install in the&#xA;  camera. The photographer merely pulls a paper tab to&#xA;  shift the exposed negative out of position and a new&#xA;  one into position. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The procedure for using and developing all of this film&#xA;  has not changed since introduction. “Premium 1000” is&#xA;  produced in small lots at the Denver plant. After&#xA;  packaging, the film is shipped to dealers across the&#xA;  country for display and sale; a remarkably stable film&#xA;  with a shelf life of eighteen months, “Premium 1000”&#xA;  has an excellent reputation in the trade. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  THE SITUATION &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  During the last 48 hours Sales, Manufacturing and&#xA;  Research have been working to resolve this sudden and&#xA;  serious problem with the “Premium 1000” film. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Customer and dealer complaints about fogged sheet&#xA;  film are mounting. This crisis now requires immediate&#xA;  action before “Premium 1000” has to be removed from&#xA;  the market entirely. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  During the past ten days, dealers in several sales&#xA;  districts have had customer complaints of fogged sheet&#xA;  film. In some cases, dealers have accumulated&#xA;  complaints for several days before they reported them. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Complaints, mounting every day, have since spread to&#xA;  all sales districts in the country. Right now there are&#xA;  complaints from 682 of our 7000 dealers. Although&#xA;  Sales is replacing each box of fogged film with two new&#xA;  boxes, this has not placated anyone. Two commercial&#xA;  studios, for example, threaten total cancellation of&#xA;  further use of our products because our film, which&#xA;  they used to photograph unique events, was fogged and&#xA;  the pictures consequently ruined. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Sales has been very concerned by several&#xA;  manufacturing problems which have resulted in failures&#xA;  to meet delivery requirements. For example: a serious&#xA;  fire two months ago in the “Premium 1000” film&#xA;  emulsion department resulted in the discharge of&#xA;  several employees for carelessness and the intensive&#xA;  training of the new emulsion mixers; delivery quantity&#xA;  difficulties on interleaf paper for over a month after the&#xA;  acquisition; delay in arrival of the new bulk raw&#xA;  ingredient storage containers. Though the interleaf&#xA;  delivery difficulties cleared up by acquiring a new&#xA;  suppler, all of the new bulk storage containers have not&#xA;  arrived and so the old ones are still being used. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Sales of sheet film, as well as film-pack, have quickly&#xA;  dropped and some professionals have begun using&#xA;  competitive brands. So far, replacing the fogged film&#xA;  and Premium’s good reputation has kept most dealers&#xA;  from defecting. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Sales found that all “Premium 1000” film is shipped,&#xA;  distributed, stocked and sold by dealers the same way.&#xA;  They also found that all complaints so far are coming&#xA;  from small outlets where turnover is very slow, but they&#xA;  expect to hear complaints from the larger outlets soon. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  None of the film was outdated and the fogging was&#xA;  seen as soon as it was developed rather than later.&#xA;  Sales asks that we stop production for a couple of days&#xA;  until Manufacturing thoroughly checks out their&#xA;  operation (i.e., effects of the fire, effectiveness of&#xA;  emulsion mixer training, and possible contamination by&#xA;  the new storage containers). The expense involved in&#xA;  doing this would be about \$30,000. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Manufacturing believes the new zip-top sheet film&#xA;  package is responsible. Because of substantial&#xA;  customer complaints that our package was hard to&#xA;  open, Sales rushed the introduction of the easier to&#xA;  open zip-top package five weeks ago. There was no Page 2 of 2&#xA;  time for thorough testing. The problem started since&#xA;  then. Manufacturing recommends going back to the&#xA;  former package. It was used for three years without&#xA;  difficulty. This will gain time to further investigate the&#xA;  zip-top package. They urge an immediate hold on&#xA;  expansion of the zip-top package to other “Premium&#xA;  1000” film. This proposal would require a commitment&#xA;  of only \$20,000, but could invite an added source of&#xA;  known customer dissatisfaction at this critical time.&#xA;  Research has conducted tests on sample returns. Their&#xA;  findings are below. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  THE LAB REPORT &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Memo from the Research Director (delivered 4 days&#xA;  after the first reports started coming in)&#xA;  We have studied the samples of returned fogged film&#xA;  provided by Sales and have attempted to reproduce the&#xA;  fogging exactly as it appears on the returns. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  We analyzed fifty returned boxes of film and found two&#xA;  things they all had in common: all negatives in a box are&#xA;  fogged; fogging is even across the entire surface of each&#xA;  negative. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  We then took thirty-six samples of good sheet film from&#xA;  the plant warehouse and carefully subjected these to a&#xA;  variety of tests. The only way we were able to&#xA;  reproduce exactly the unique fogging effect was to&#xA;  expose the sheet film to a source of radiation (such as&#xA;  an x-ray machine). &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Recognizing that this type of film is supersensitive and is&#xA;  more susceptible to contamination, and having clearly&#xA;  demonstrated that radiation produces the exact&#xA;  characteristics of the returned fogged film, we believe&#xA;  that a source of radioactivity is the root of the problem. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  We know that traces of radioactive fallout have&#xA;  contaminated various products in the past.

It is also useful for development of small systems and rapid prototyping because it takes less lines of code than some other languages and it has an interactive mode for fast feedback. One notable Scala framework is Akka which uses the actor model of concurrent computation. Many of Odersky's presentations are on YouTube and there is a list of tools implemented with Scala on wiki.scala-lang.org.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An implicit point is that tools and frameworks written in Scala inherently have Scala integration and usually a Scala API. Then other APIs may be added to support other languages beginning with Java since Scala is already integrated and in fact critically depends on Java.

That is why in answer to your question I have pointed towards tools and frameworks written in Scala and Spark is one example.

Make a corupus of all the words observed as your vector of inputs.  Make a corpus off all the tags that are observed as your vector of outputs.  An NB classifier with multiple outputs is the equivalent of having multiple NB classifiers with one output each (so do whichever is easier to implement in whatever software framework you're using).  Treat each element as a training sample where a given input (a word) is a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; if that word is present and a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; if that word isn't.  Use the same binary scheme for the output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This brute forces the application of the NB Classifier to your data, and leaves you to find meaning by still haivng to mine the huge set of classifiers you'll be left with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More Graceful: Process your data&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the approach I'd recommend if you want to run with one multiple-class NB Classifier.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your goal here is to figure out how to map each set of tags to a single class.

We don't just want to memorize the the link between a given input and a given output (otherwise you wouldn't be modeling data, you'd be memorizing 1:1 connections with a dict / hash / relational database table / etc).  We want to capture the underlying pattern in the data from only looking at the training data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's expand a little on your gravity example.  You have your 10 training samples showing the start and ending position of an object dropped.  For consistency, let's say the object was dropped the moment the object's location was initially recorded and the ending location was recorded at some precise time interval later (but before the object hit the ground).  Let's also say the model (neural network in this case) managed to precisely learn the expected change in location since it just comes down to subtraction in one axis.  You can show it another 10, 100, 1000 examples that all leverage the connection found and your model will keep performing well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why not keep going to 10k, 100k, or even more samples?  Theoretically, if you managed to isolate the connection and run the experiment the same way each time, your model will always work.  But realistically, something is going to eventually change in the system.  You hire a new lab assistant who tends to press the 'record location' button well after having dropped the object (giving the object more initial velocity, which you won't notice having only recorded location).  Maybe you lost your initial ball and had to use something else which is lighter and catches the wind more (so it goes slower).  .... the longer you run the experiment, the more small changes will creep into your system.  Eventually these changes will alter the connection enough to make your initial model wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When modeling data, we want to capture the underlying patterns and acknowledge that the model only matters as long as those underlying patterns stay relevant.  It's not really about the number of samples.  It's about the connections / the model itself.  The number of samples just happens to be one of the better proxies we have - the more samples you use, the more confident you have some underlying pattern.  'Statistical validity' is one stab at solving this, though it's validity is still up for question in the era of big data.

One of the other options include &lt;strong&gt;certifications&lt;/strong&gt; (linked at the above-mentioned page, but, in my opinion, the only certification worth considering is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.informs.org/Certification-Continuing-Ed/Analytics-Certification&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Certified Analytics Professional&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;em&gt;solid&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vendor-neutral&lt;/em&gt; certification from a reputable INFORMS).

While similar, data science is IMHO more statistics-focused, whereas operations research is more math-focused, at least that's how I see it. Despite all the popularity and &quot;gold rush&quot; of data science, operations research career is a solid one, just not as hot. Of course, if you're excited about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning and, especially, deep learning, data science career is the way to go.

The length of the series varies by meter - for some I have several years, others only a few months, etc. Many display significant seasonality, and often multiple layers - within the day, week, or year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've been working on is clustering of these time series. My work is academic for the moment, and while I'm doing other analysis of the data as well, I have a specific goal to carry out some clustering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did some initial work where I calculated various features (percentage used on weekends vs. weekday, percentage used in different time blocks, etc.). I then moved on to looking at using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to obtain the distance between different series, and clustering based on the difference values, and I've found several papers related to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Question&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Will the seasonality in a specific series changing cause my clustering to be incorrect? And if so, how do I deal with it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My concern is that the distances obtained by DTW could be misleading in the cases where the pattern in a time series has changed. This could lead to incorrect clustering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case the above is unclear, consider these examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Example 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A meter has low readings from midnight until 8AM, the readings then increase sharply for the next hour and stay high from 9AM until 5PM, then decrease sharply over the next hour and then stay low from 6PM until midnight. The meter continues this pattern consistently every day for several months, but then changes to a pattern where readings simply stay at a consistent level throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Example 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A meter shows approximately the same amount of energy being consumed each month. After several years, it changes to a pattern where energy usage is higher during the summer months before returning to the usual amount.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Possible Directions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I've wondered whether I can continue to compare whole time series, but split them and consider them as a separate series if the pattern changes considerably. However, to do this I'd need to be able to detect such changes. Also, I just don't know if this is a suitable way or working with the data.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I've also considered splitting the data and considering it as many separate time series. For instance, I could consider every day/meter combination as a separate series. However, I'd then need to do similarly if I wanted to consider the weekly/monthly/yearly patterns. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this would work, but it's potentially quite onerous and I'd hate to go down this path if there's a better way that I'm missing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Further Notes&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are things that have come up in comments, or things I've thought of due to comments, which might be relevant. I'm putting them here so people don't have to read through everything to get relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm working in Python, but have rpy for those places where R is more suitable. I'm not necessarily looking for a Python answer though - if someone has a practical answer of what should be done I'm happy to figure out implementation details myself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have a lot of working &quot;rough draft&quot; code - I've done some DTW runs, I've done a couple of different types of clustering, etc. I think I largely understand the direction I'm taking, and what I'm really looking for is related to how I process my data before finding distances, running clustering, etc. Given this, I suspect the answer would be the same whether the distances between series are calculated via DTW or a simpler Euclidean Distance (ED).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have found these papers especially informative on time series and DTW and they may be helpful if some background is needed to the topic area: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/selected_publications.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/selected_publications.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S. - I can't post in Meta or even a comment yet, so sorry for the off-topic bit, but: I love this site and hope it picks up steam!

My suggestion is to start with 9*2 = 18 to cover a wider range of possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be sure your test and validation sets are selected &quot;fairly&quot;: a random selection and varying the seed some number of times to test different configurations would be ok.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, a number of neurons equal to the number of features will tend to make each hidden neuron try to learn &lt;em&gt;that special thing&lt;/em&gt; that each feature is adding, so will could say it is &quot;learning each feature&quot; separately. Although this sounds good it might tend to overfitting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since your number of inputs and your dataset size is small its ok to start with a hidden layer size of the double (18) and start lowering down. When the training error and test error stabilize in a difference lower than a threshold then you could have found a better generalizing model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are very good at finding local optima by exploring deeply a solution from a starting point. However, the starting point it is also very important. If you are not getting a good generalization you might try to find good initial starting points with methods of Hybrid Neural Networks. A common one, for example, is using genetic algorithms to find an initial combination of weights and then start the neural from that point. Given that your search space would be better covered (in case your problem actually needs that).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for every problem in machine learning is very important to clean your data before introducing it to the NN. Try to be very detailed in order to avoid the NN to learn things you already know. For example if you know how two features are correlated improve the input data by making this correlation explicit so less workload is given to the NN (that might actually get you in trouble).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5143" LastActivityDate="2014-12-25T15:40:43.283" CommentCount="5" />

At the minimum number of nodes, you'll see the worst performance.  As you increase the number of nodes, you'll see an increase in performance (reduction of error).  At some point N, you'll see the performance seems to hit an upper limit and increasing nodes beyond this will stop giving significant performance gains.  Further increases may start to hurt performance a little as training gets more difficult).  That point N is the number of nodes you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;How it worked for me:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first time I used this methodology, it created a beautiful almost-sigmoid-looking function with a very clear number of nodes that were needed to achieve good results.

I was trying to predict google searchs from the last 6 months values, or 6 values in monthly data. Daily data would imply a work on 180 past values. (I have 10 years of data so 120 points in monthly data / 500+ in weekly data/ 3500+ in daily data)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other approach would be to &quot;merge&quot; daily data in weekly/monthly data. But some questions arise from this process. Some data can be averaged because their sum represent something. Rainfall for example, the amount of rain in a given week will be the sum of the amounts for each days composing the weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my case I am dealing with prices, financial rates and other things. For the prices it is common in my field to take volume exchanged into account, so the weekly data would be a weighted average. For financial rates it is a bit more complex a some formulas are involved to build weekly rates from daily rates.  For the other things i don't know the underlying properties. I think those properties are important to avoid meaningless indicators (an average of fiancial rates would be a non-sense for example). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So three questions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel like breaking weekly/monthly data into daily data like i've done is somewhat wrong because I am introducing quantities that have no sense in real life.

In case you don't know, these models are called autoregressive (AR) models. This answers your first question. Of course it is useful to include the previous value of your time series. There is a whole set of models based on that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second approach is taking a window and extracting some features to describe the time series at each point in time. Then you use a conventional machine learning technique to predict future values as typically done. This is more common in a classification or regression setting but future values can be thought of as classifying future values. This technique has the advantage of dramatically reducing the number of features, although you usually lose characteristics associated with time. This addresses your second concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another model that could be helpful in your case is the vector autoregressive model (VAR) (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;'s notation):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\left( \begin{array}{ccc}&#xA;y_{1,t} \\&#xA;y_{2,t} &#xA;\end{array}\right) = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}c_{1} \\ c_{2}\end{array}\right) + \left( \begin{array}{ccc}A_{1,1} &amp;amp; A_{1,2} \\ A_{2,1} &amp;amp; A_{2,2}\end{array}\right)\left( \begin{array}{ccc}&#xA;y_{1,t-1} \\&#xA;y_{2,t-1} &#xA;\end{array}\right) + \left( \begin{array}{ccc}&#xA;e_{1,t} \\&#xA;e_{2,t} &#xA;\end{array}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see that $y_{1,t}$ has a contribution from its previous value $t_{1,t-1}$ but also includes the value of the other series $y_{2,t-1}$ in a linear combination. As usual, the purpose is to find the elements of $A_{i,j}$ that minimize some measure of error between observed values and estimated values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A general suggestion: The first thing you need to do is to test the autocorrelation of your first series in order to confirm that an autoregressive approach is suitable and then test the cross correlation between both series to support the idea that using the second series to improve your predictions is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4621" LastActivityDate="2014-12-29T06:53:32.200" CommentCount="2" />

It sounds like you're reducing the feature space through some front-end processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Example&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Context:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say you're using NBC to model if you go outside given the high temperature that day.  Let's say temperature is given to you as an int in Celsius which just happened to range between 0 and 40 degrees.  Over one year of running the experiment - recording the temperature and if you went outside - you'll have 365 data points.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Internal Representation:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The internal structure the NBC uses will be a matrix with 82 values (41 values for your one input variable * 2 because you have two states in your output class).  That means each bin will have an average of &lt;code&gt;365/82 = 8.9ish&lt;/code&gt; samples.  In practice, you'll probably see a few bins with lots more samples than this and a many bins with 0 samples.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A Pitfall&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say you saw 8 cases at a temperature of 5 C (all of which you stayed inside) and nothing at a temp of 3 or 4 C.  If, after the model is built, you 'ask it' what class a temp of 4 C should be in.  It won't know.  Intuitively, we'd say &quot;stay inside&quot;, but the model won't.  One way to fix this is to bin the classes 0,1,2,... into larger groups of temperatures (i.e., class 0 for temp 0-3, class 1 for temp 4-7, etc).  The extreme case of this would be two temperature states &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;.  The actual cut-off should depend more on the data observed, but one such scheme is converting temperatures within &lt;code&gt;0-20&lt;/code&gt; to &quot;low&quot; and &lt;code&gt;21-40&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;high&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This front end processing seems to be what you're talking about as the &quot;wrapper&quot; around the NBC.

This will be way easier to process and will take way less data to confidently train at the expense of complexity.  One example of a drawback of such a scheme is:  Say the actual pattern is that you love spring and fall weather and only go outside when it's not too hot or not too cold.  So your outside adventures are evenly split across the upper part of the &quot;low&quot; class and the lower part of the &quot;high&quot; class giving you a really useless model.

With the monthly dataset you have 120 data points, which is sufficient to get a timeseries model even with seasonality in your data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To obtain say weekly or monthly data from daily data, you can use smoothing functions. For financial data, you can use moving average or exponential smoothing, but if those do not work for your data, then you can use the spline smoothing function &quot;smooth.spline&quot; in R: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/smooth.spline.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/smooth.spline.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model returned will have less noise than the original daily dataset, and you can get values for the desired time points. Finally, these data points can be used in your timeseries analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from weekly/monthly to daily data ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To obtain daily data when you have monthly or weekly data, you can use interpolation. First, you should find an equation to describe the data. In order to do this you should plot the data (e.g. price over time). When factors are known to you, this equation should be influenced by those factors. When factors are unknown, you can use a best fit equation. The simplest would be a linear function or piecewise linear function, but for financial data this won't work well. In that case, you should consider piecewise cubic spline interpolation. This link goes into more detail on possible interpolation functions: &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.math.gatech.edu/~meyer/MA6635/chap2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://people.math.gatech.edu/~meyer/MA6635/chap2.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In R, there is a method for doing interpolation of timeseries data. Here you would create a vector with say weekly values and NAs in the gaps for the daily values, and then use the &quot;interpNA&quot; function to get the interpolated values for the NAs. However, this function uses the &quot;approx&quot; function to get the interpolated values, which applies either a linear or constant interpolation. To perform cubic spline interpolation in R, you should use the &quot;splinefun&quot; function instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something to be aware of is that timeseries models typically do some sort of averaging to forecast future values whether you are looking at exponential smoothing or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) methods amongst others. So a timeseries model to forecast daily values may not be the best choice, but the weekly or monthly models may be better. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6648" LastActivityDate="2015-01-03T07:58:10.663" CommentCount="2" />

However, I think that for R-focused work, disk operations are much less critical than memory ones, as I've mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When choosing a specific &lt;em&gt;Linux distribution&lt;/em&gt;, I suggest using a well-supported one, such as Debian or, even better, Ubuntu (if you care more about support, choose their LTS version). I'd rather not buy parts and assemble custom box, but some people would definitely prefer that route - for that you really need to know hardware well, but potential compatibility could still be an issue. The next paragraph provides some examples for both &lt;em&gt;commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;custom&lt;/em&gt; solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should you be interested in the &lt;em&gt;custom system&lt;/em&gt; route, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/295552-28-multiprocessor-multicore-system-rendering-workstation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt; might be worth reading, as it contains some interesting pricing numbers (just to get an idea of potential savings) and also sheds some light on &lt;em&gt;multiprocessor vs. multi-core&lt;/em&gt; alternatives (obviously, the &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; is different, but nevertheless could be useful). As I said, I would go the COTS route, mainly due to reliability and compatibility issues. In terms of single-processor multi-core systems, your budget is more than enough. However, when we go to multiprocessor workstations (I'm not even talking about servers), even two-processor configurations can go over your budget easily. Some, not far away, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/workstations/z820.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HP Z820 Workstation&lt;/a&gt;. It starts from 2439 USD, but in minimal configuration. When you upgrade it to match your desired specs (if it's even possible), I'm sure that we'll be talking about 5K USD price range (extrapolating from the series' higher-level models). What I like about HP Z820, though, is the fact that this system is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201011-6754&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ubuntu certified&lt;/a&gt;. Considering system compatibility and assuming your desire to run Ubuntu, the best way to approach your problem is to go through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/certification&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ubuntu-certified hardware lists&lt;/a&gt; and shortlist systems that you like. Just for the sake of completeness, take a look at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediaworkstations.net/i-x2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interesting multiprocessor system&lt;/a&gt;, which in compatible configuration might cost less than from HP or other major vendors. However, it's multimedia-oriented as well as it's reliability and compatibility are unknown, not to mention that it's way over your specified budget.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;-focused software, I highly recommend you to use &lt;em&gt;RStudio Server&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;RStudio&lt;/em&gt;, as that will provide you with an opportunity to be able to work from any Internet-enabled location (provided you computer will be running, obviously). Another advice that I have is to keep an eye on &lt;em&gt;alternative &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; distributions&lt;/em&gt;. I'm not talking about commercial expensive ones, but about emerging open source projects, such as &lt;code&gt;pqR&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pqr-project.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pqr-project.org&lt;/a&gt;.

The initial query should have some words as a reference point to compare to the words in the document. Not knowing whether the query is a sentence or arbitrary list, you are restricted to a method that does some kind of histogram comparison of the frequency of the words matching in the documents. You can perform naive summations of keyword mappings counts, look at keyword likelihoods in the normalized distributions, or give a distribution of weighting based on the strongest matches. More exotic functions will be based on your prior belief of how the words should be compared. Working within a Bayesian Framework you can see your prior assumptions explicitly.

Say, you moderate a web forum which is sometimes flooded with spam messages. These messages are easily identifiable - most often they contain specific words like &quot;buy&quot;, &quot;porn&quot;, etc. and a URL to outer resources. You want to create filter that will alert you about such suspecious messages. It turns to be pretty easy - you get list of features (e.g. list of suspicious words and presence of a URL) and train simple logistic regression (a.k.a. perceptron), i.e. model like: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;g(w0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wnxn)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;x1..xn&lt;/code&gt; are your features (either presence of specific word or a URL), &lt;code&gt;w0..wn&lt;/code&gt; - learned coefficients and &lt;code&gt;g()&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function&quot;&gt;logistic function&lt;/a&gt; to make result be between 0 and 1. It's very simple classifier, but for this simple task it may give very good results, creating linear decision boundary. Assuming you used only 2 features, this boundary may look something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.mblondel.org/images/perceptron_linear.png&quot; alt=&quot;linear boundary&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here 2 axes represent features (e.g. number of occurrences of specific word in a message, normalized around zero), red points stay for spam and blue points - for normal messages, while black line shows separation line. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But soon you notice that some good messages contain a lot of occurrences of word &quot;buy&quot;, but no URLs, or extended discussion of &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/713247/what-is-the-best-way-to-programatically-detect-porn-images&quot;&gt;porn detection&lt;/a&gt;, not actually refferring to porn movies. Linear decision boundary simply cannot handle such situations. Instead you need something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/courses/MachineLearning/exercises/ex8materials/ex8b_100.png&quot; alt=&quot;non-linear boundary&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This new non-linear decision boundary is much more &lt;strong&gt;flexible&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. it can fit the data much closer. There are many ways to achieve this non-linearity - you can use polynomial features (e.g. &lt;code&gt;x1^2&lt;/code&gt;) or their combination (e.g. &lt;code&gt;x1*x2&lt;/code&gt;) or project them out to a higher dimension like in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method&quot;&gt;kernel methods&lt;/a&gt;. But in neural networks it's common to solve it by &lt;strong&gt;combining perceptrons&lt;/strong&gt; or, in other words, by building &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;multilayer perceptron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Non-linearity here comes from logistic function between layers. The more layers, the more sophisticated patterns may be covered by MLP. Single layer (perceptron) can handle simple spam detection, network with 2-3 layers can catch tricky combinations of features, and networks of 5-9 layers, used by large research labs and companies like Google, may model the whole language or detect cats on images. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is essential reason to have &lt;strong&gt;deep architectures&lt;/strong&gt; - they can &lt;em&gt;model more sophisticated patterns&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why deep networks are hard to train?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With only one feature and linear decision boundary it's in fact enough to have only 2 training examples - one positive and one negative. With several features and/or non-linear decision boundary you need several orders more examples to cover all possible cases (e.g. you need not only find examples with &lt;code&gt;word1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;word2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;word3&lt;/code&gt;, but also with all possible their combinations). And in real life you need to deal with hundreds and thousands of features (e.g. words in a language or pixels in an image) and at least several layers to have enough non-linearity. Size of a data set, needed to fully train such networks, easily exceeds 10^30 examples, making it totally impossible to get enough data. In other words, with many features and many layers our decision function becomes &lt;strong&gt;too flexible&lt;/strong&gt; to be able to learn it &lt;strong&gt;precisely&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, ways to learn it &lt;em&gt;approximately&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if we were working in probabilistic settings, then instead of learning frequencies of all combinations of all features we could assume that they are independent and learn only individual frequencies, reducing full and unconstrained &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_classifier&quot;&gt;Bayes classifier&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier&quot;&gt;Naive Bayes&lt;/a&gt; and thus requiring much, much less data to learn. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In neural networks there were several attempts to (meaningfully) reduce complexity (flexibility) of decision function. For example, convolutional networks, extensively used in image classification, assume only local connections between nearby pixels and thus try only learn combinations of pixels inside small &quot;windows&quot; (say, 16x16 pixels = 256 input neurons) as opposed to full images (say, 100x100 pixels = 10000 input neurons). Other approaches include feature engineering, i.e. searching for specific, human-discovered descriptors of input data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Manually discovered features are very promising actually. In natural language processing, for example, it's sometimes helpful to use special dictionaries (like those containing spam-specific words) or catch negation (e.g. &quot;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; good&quot;). And in computer vision things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SURF&quot;&gt;SURF descriptors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_features&quot;&gt;Haar-like features&lt;/a&gt; are almost irreplaceable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the problem with manual feature engineering is that it takes literally years to come up with good descriptors. Moreover, these features are often specific &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Unsupervised pretraining&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it turns out that we can &lt;em&gt;obtain good features automatically&lt;/em&gt; right from the data using such algorithms as &lt;strong&gt;autoencoders&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;restricted Boltzmann machines&lt;/strong&gt;. I described them in detail in my other &lt;a href=&quot;http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/114385/what-is-the-difference-between-convolutional-neural-networks-restricted-boltzma/117188#117188&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;, but in short they allow to &lt;strong&gt;find repeated patterns in the input data&lt;/strong&gt; and transform it into higher-level features. For example, given only row pixel values as an input, these algorithms may identify and pass higher whole edges, then from these edges construct figures and so on, until you get really high-level descriptors like variations in faces. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/oGBRR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;deep learning&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After such (unsupervised) pretraining network is usually converted into MLP and used for normal supervised training. Note, that pretraining is done layer-wise. This significantly reduces solution space for learning algorithm (and thus number of training examples needed) as it only needs to learn parameters &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; each layer without taking into account other layers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;And beyond...&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised pretraining have been here for some time now, but recently other algorithms were found to improve learning both - together with pretraining and without it. One notable example of such algorithms is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dropout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - simple technique, that randomly &quot;drops out&quot; some neurons during training, creatig some distortion and preventing networks of following data too closely.

For instance, in the case of text mining you may begin with a raw log of thousands of text messages (e.g. SMS, email, social network messages, etc) and generate features by removing low-value words (i.e. stopwords), using certain size blocks of words (i.e. n-grams) or applying other rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Extraction&lt;/strong&gt; -- After generating features, it is often necessary to test transformations of the original features and select a subset of this pool of potential original and derived features for use in your model (i.e. feature extraction and selection). Testing derived values is a common step because the data may contain important information which has a non-linear pattern or relationship with your outcome, thus the importance of the data element may only be apparent in its transformed state (e.g. higher order derivatives).

But how this function might look? Without considering the model itself, usually what happens is that there is some noise. And this noise can be in $Y$ and also can be in $X$. This noise gives use the probabilistic setup of the problem, because without it we would have only to solve some equations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is important to understand that the noise defines the distribution. So a random variable can be imagined as a function having something fixed and well defined and something not fixed, but taking values according with a distribution. If the variable part does not exist, that you would not have a random variable, right, it would be a simple formula. But its not. Now the $P(X)$ incorporates what happens in $X$ alone, and $P(Y)$ what is in $Y$ alone. When you predict the decision theory says that you are interested in saying which is the most probable value $y_i$ given some input value $x_i$. So you are interested in finding $P(Y|X)$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint probability is not always completely described by marginal probabilities. In fact, is completely described only when marginal probabilities are independent. Which means for r.v. $X, Y$ knowing $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ does not put you in position to know the joint density $P(X, Y)$ (thought for independence you have  $P(X,Y)=P(X)P(Y)$). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here you can go directly and try to estimate $P(Y|X)$. In fact if your only interest in only in prediction, this might be a fair bet. A lot of supervised learning algorithms tries to estimate directly this probability. They are called discriminant classifiers. The reason is because they are used to classify something to  the class with maximal conditional probability, you discriminate (choose) the maximum value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now arriving at your question. Notice the obvious $P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X)$ than you see that by trying learning the joint probability, you also learn the conditional (what you need for prediction). This kind of approach is called generative, because knowing the joint probability you can not only predict, but you can generate new data for your problem. More than that, knowing the join probability can give you more insights related with how what are you model works. You can find such kind of information which is not contained only in marginal distributions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some final notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Technically you do not minimize the error function, but it's expectation.

In the drawing, this corresponds to the DoG's located above and below. If this pixel is a local extrema, then you have a candidate keypoint. Keep in mind that candidates can be discarded based on other criteria.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have these keypoints, you proceed to generate descriptors. For each keypoint, calculate an image gradient. As you should know, gradients tell you the direction of maximum rate of change. Therefore, you can construct a grid around each keypoint that is oriented according to the dominant gradient around that point. This grid has subregions (usually 16 subregions) and for each subregion, calculate an 8-bin histogram. Finally, concatenate every histogram you obtained from every subregion in your grid and that is the feature vector for that keypoint (actually, the full feature vector also includes the location and rotation angle.)

Normally, we solve SVM optimisation problem by Quadratic Programming, because it can do optimisation tasks with constrains. If you use Gradient Descent or other optimisation algorithms which without satisfying the constrains of hard-margin SVM, you should still get a result, but that's not a hard-margin SVM hyperplane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, with non-linearly separable data, usually we choose &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hard-margin SVM + feature transformations&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;use soft-margin SVM directly(In practical, soft-margin SVM usually get good results)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your question, and hope I do answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1003" LastEditorUserId="1003" LastEditDate="2015-01-25T08:01:49.653" LastActivityDate="2015-01-25T08:01:49.653" CommentCount="2" />

SVM pose a quadratic optimization problem that looks for maximizing the margin between both classes and minimizing the amount of miss-classifications. However, for non-separable problems, in order to find a solution, the miss-classification constraint must be relaxed, and this is done by setting the mentioned &quot;regularization&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, intuitively, as lambda grows larger they less the wrongly classified examples are allowed (or the highest the price the pay in the loss function).

If you use the entire data set to establish the priors (including the 10% of validation data), then yes, it is &quot;cheating&quot; since each of the 10 subset models uses information from the corresponding validation set (i.e., it is not truly a blind test). However, if the priors are recomputed for each fold using only the 90% of data used for that fold, then it is a &quot;fair&quot; validation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of the effect of this &quot;cheating&quot; is if you have a single, extreme outlier in your data. Normally, with k-fold cross-validation, there would be one fold where the outlier is in the validation data and not the training data. When applying the corresponding classifier to the outlier during validation, it would likely perform poorly. However, if the training data for that fold included global statistics (from the entire data set), then the outlier would influence the statistics (priors) for that fold, potentially resulting in artificially favorable performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="964" LastEditorUserId="964" LastEditDate="2015-01-30T13:52:46.097" LastActivityDate="2015-01-30T13:52:46.097" CommentCount="2" />

Even a single issue which has a cascading effect, can trigger 20-30 emails.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, what I want to do is to implement a system which will be able to extract important features out of an alert email - like server IP address, type of problem, severity of problem etc. and also classify the emails into proper category, like &lt;code&gt;CPU-Load-Customer1-Server2, MySQL-Replication-Customer2-DBServer3&lt;/code&gt; etc. We will then have a pre-defined set of debugging steps for each category, in order to help the Ops team to rectify the problem faster. Also, the feature extractor will provide input data to the team for a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far I have been able to train &lt;em&gt;NaiveBayesClassifier&lt;/em&gt; with supervised learning techniques i.e. labeled training data(cluster data), and able to classify new unseen emails into its proper cluster/category.

Note that a closely related term &lt;em&gt;latent feature&lt;/em&gt; is frequently used within the &lt;em&gt;machine learning&lt;/em&gt; domain. It seems to me that latent variables resemble what you call &quot;combinations/subsets/segments of the IVs&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By hypothesizing - usually, based on theory or domain knowledge - the &lt;strong&gt;latent structure&lt;/strong&gt; of factors, LVM or SEM are able to automatically confirm or decline those hypotheses. This is done by using a combination of &lt;em&gt;exploratory factor analysis (EFA)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)&lt;/em&gt; (see my answer ). While EFA is frequently performed independently (and maybe that's enough for your purposes), doing it along with CFA represents a large part of LVM/SEM methodology, which is usually completed by performing &lt;em&gt;path analysis&lt;/em&gt;, which is concerned about relationships between latent variables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;ecosystem&lt;/em&gt; offers a variety of &lt;strong&gt;packages&lt;/strong&gt; for performing LVM/SEM in its entirety or for performing EFA, CFA and path analysis.

Should one focus on characteristics of the data that is actually feeding the model (that is what would 'train' function in R's caret package suggest, as you can put the pre-processing object in there directly) and apply these to the test set, or maybe one should capture the real characteristics of the data (from the whole untouched training set) and apply these? If the second option is better, maybe it would be worth it to capture the characteristics of the data by merging the training and test data together just for pre-processing step to get as accurate estimates as possible (I've actually never heard of anyone doing that though)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know I can simply test some of the approaches specified here, and I surely will, but are there any suggestions based on theory or your intuition/experience on how to tackle this problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also have one additional and optional question.

Each movie is represented by a sparse vector of user scores (row number = user ID, value = user's score)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I build N random vectors. The vector length matches the length of the movie vectors (i.e. the number of users). The vector values are +1 or -1. I actually encode these vectors as binary to save space, with +1 mapped to 1 and -1 mapped to 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I build sketch vectors for each movie by taking the dot product of the movie and each of the N random vectors (or rather, if I create a matrix R by laying the N random vectors horizontally and layering them on top of each other then the sketch for movie m is R*m), then taking the sign of each element in the resulting vector, so I end with a sketch vector for each movie of +1s and -1s, which again I encode as binary. Each vector is length N bits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Next I look for similar sketches by doing the following&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I split the sketch vector into b bands of r bits&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each band of r bits is a number. I combine that number with the band number and add the movie to a hash bucket under that number. Each movie can be added to more than one bucket.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I then look in each bucket. Any movies that are in the same bucket are candidate pairs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing this to 3.6.3 of mmds, my AND step is when I look at bands of r bits - a pair of movies pass the AND step if the r bits have the same value. My OR step happens in the buckets: movies are candidate pairs if they are both in any of the buckets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book suggests I can &quot;amplify&quot; my results by adding more AND and OR steps, but I'm at a loss for how to do this practically as the explanation of the construction process for further layers is in terms of checking pairwise equality rather than coming up with bucket numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone help me understand how to do this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8030" LastActivityDate="2015-02-05T20:40:51.363" Title="Amplifying a Locality Sensitive Hash" Tags="&lt;machine-learning&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" />

You first, combine both these corpora and form 25 document corpus and then form the TDM, where terms become the rows (let's say there are 300 terms) and the 25 documents become the 25 columns.

I think that it is important to understand that this aspect is really of secondary importance. The &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; should be on two words, which the term &quot;data science&quot; consists of: &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Focus on data&lt;/strong&gt; means that it is important to think about data science (or BI, or analytics) tasks in terms of the corresponding &lt;em&gt;domain knowledge&lt;/em&gt; as well as to pay attention to &lt;em&gt;data quality&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;representativeness&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Focus on science&lt;/strong&gt; means adhering to &lt;em&gt;scientific approaches&lt;/em&gt; to data collection and analysis, of which &lt;em&gt;reproducibility&lt;/em&gt; plays an important role. A &lt;em&gt;programming language&lt;/em&gt; for data science is just a &lt;strong&gt;tool&lt;/strong&gt; and, therefore, should be chosen to match the task at hand.

Treat each question as a document, compute a term-document matrix and use it to retrieve the most similar question when a customer asks sometihng. The idea was to then simply pick the answer given to the question by the human (with some modifications). However, this gives really abysmal results and does not match to previous questions very well. Even if I get this approach to work well, we would be limited to the questions that already been asked. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another thing I thought about was to modify something like ALICE and write some AIML for customer support related QA. However, that would take a lot of very precise AIML writint to work well. This solution would not be able to scale to other languages, which is something I want to do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another idea I have is to try and cluster the answers given by the customer support staff (they are more likely to be aligned compared to the questions asked by customers). This would give me a sense of what questions are similar. Then I can use something like LSA on the questions and fall back to the first approach.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yet another way is to build an ontology of the domain specific knowledge and given a question decide which category the question falls into. The questions from the chat logs can then be mapped to the ontology and I could train classifiers for mapping questions to different knowledge areas. Once I reach the leaf nodes, I can give back pre-defined answers. However, my reservation is that mapping chat logs to the ontology would be very tedious. Is there a good way to map the existing QA to the ontology?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8145" LastActivityDate="2015-02-09T07:42:44.700" Title="Question and Answer Chatbot for Customer Support" Tags="&lt;machine-learning&gt;&lt;nlp&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="1" />

In addition, MapReduce doesn't run your queries to different nodes separately. If your $query_{A}$ runs on $data_{A}$, what we do here is to divide $data_{A}$ to different nodes and run $query_{A}$ on these nodes on $PartOfData_{A}$ in parallel. By the way, you can use Sqoop to migrate the data from your DB to HDFS(it is used to store data separately).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are steps for you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;migrate all/part of your data to HDFS&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;transform your queries to MapReduce version program&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1003" LastActivityDate="2015-02-07T02:41:06.783" CommentCount="0" />

[it] can never be the whole&#xA;  story, but &lt;strong&gt;nothing else can serve as the foundation stone - as the&#xA;  first step&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an enormous amount of information on approaches, guidelines and procedures for performing EDA. Potential starting points might include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/eda.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EDA page&lt;/a&gt; on the NIST's Engineering Statistics Handbook website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/caddis/da_exploratory_0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EDA pages&lt;/a&gt; on the EPA's website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~hseltman/309/Book/chapter4.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;corresponding chapter&lt;/a&gt;  from the book &quot;Experimental Design for Behavioral and Social Sciences&quot; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cll.stanford.edu/~langley/cogsys/behrens97pm.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;survey research paper on EDA&lt;/a&gt; by Begrens (1997), among many others.

However, I've figured that a wider exposure might help the team to fix this and similar problems faster as well as increase the quality of the &lt;em&gt;machine learning (ML)&lt;/em&gt; engine of their website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem exposes itself by too many occurrences of a quite trivial &lt;em&gt;misclassification error&lt;/em&gt; on Amazon's book categories &lt;strong&gt;classification&lt;/strong&gt; (which I'm a frequent visitor of). In the following example, the underlying reason of such behavior is quite clear, but in other cases the reasons might be different. I am curious about what could be other potential &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; for misclassification and what are the &lt;em&gt;strategies/approaches&lt;/em&gt; to avoiding such problems. Without much further ado, here's how the problem appears in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was reviewing some books, related to transitioning from graduate programs (Ph.D., in particular) to work environment in academia. Among several other books, I ran across the following one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/4LSzV.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. However, let's scroll down a bit further to see the the books ratings in relevant categories. We should expect Amazon to figure out &lt;em&gt;categories&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;relevant&lt;/strong&gt; to the book's &lt;em&gt;discipline, topic and contents&lt;/em&gt;. How surprised was I (and that's an understatement!) to see the following result of Amazon.com's sophisticated ML engine and algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/KXrFh.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the only fuzzy fact that connects this book with the subject &quot;Audiology and Speech Pathology&quot; (!) is IMHO the author's last name (Boice), which, is &lt;strong&gt;close to&lt;/strong&gt; the word &quot;voice&quot;. If my guess is correct, Amazon's ML engine, for some reason, decided to take into account the book's lexicographical attribute instead of the book's most important and &lt;strong&gt;most relevant attributes&lt;/strong&gt;, such as title, topic and contents. I've seen multiple occurrences of similar absolutely incorrect ML-based decision making on Amazon.com and some other websites. So, hopefully my question makes sense as well as interesting and important enough to spark a discussion: &lt;strong&gt;What could be other potential reasons for misclassification and what are the strategies/approaches to avoiding such problems?&lt;/strong&gt; (Any related thoughts will also be appreciated.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2452" LastActivityDate="2015-02-11T13:25:28.473" Title="Reasons and prevention of trivial (and less trivial) misclassification errors?"

However the representation should give a clear picture of potencies, although high detail accuracy is not required: some sort of classification is adequate. I played with JUNG with a graph having edge weights as the change in potency and the ISOM layout thinking that it reserves (as much as possible) the edge weights but with not good results.

For that, I'm first trying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with divergences (Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon) on the per document topic distributions. However, to find # of topics for my corpus ( a 948 document dataset, extracted from larger collection, where docs about the same story are humanly annotated), it was suggested to use HDP. Unfortunately, after MANY tries, I'm still unsure I'm using the packages correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More detailed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) HDPFASTER continually increases the number of topics (in train.log file).  What is the stopping criterion (e.g. difference in avg. likelihood between successive iterations smaller than x? which x?) and/or how many cycles should I let it run? Afterwords, do I take as the correct # of topics the last line of &quot;train.log&quot; OR should I also test for minimum perplexity (It has also been suggested that Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) might be a better measure) and choose the smallest? If the latter, should I test for ALL iterations?!  Is HDPFASTER's test feature the appropriate tool for this? Last, should I --sample_hyper? Do I just use a(alpha) as input to LDA's prior alpha, perhaps divided by a number (e.g. # of topics)? What about LDA's prior beta? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) HCA continually decreases  the number of topics (in *.log file). When to stop? Do I accept the final # of topics in .log ( exp.ent =number0) OR do I search for the minimum perplexity of test set (as I assume it appears as number2 in &quot;log_2(perp)=number1,number2&quot; in .log throughout iterations), which ALWAYS appears VERY close to my initial max number of topics? Hyperparameters alpha,beta: do I sample using -D , -E? Which do I put as input to LDA's priors? Is it generally worth it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally: Is it possible that my dataset is just too small and/or 'biased/fragmented/incomplete', in the sense that each story has only 1-3 examples, while the diversity of the topics these stories discuss can be quite large?

Impurity - being the opposite of purity - is referring to the distribution of the decision categories (or class labels) within the set. Initially, each row in the table is one element and your set of elements are all rows of your table. This set is called pure if it just consists of the same class label and it is called impure if it contains all different class labels in the same proportion. Translating into the values of entropy (remember being an impurity measure, the set has in the latter case the highest possible value and in the former case (just the same class label) the lowest value. The lowest possible value for entropy is 0.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let's choose a visual respresentation to illustrate what really counts and what does not matter for the entropy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) You start off with the initial table which contains the following class labels:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CbjbT.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that for computing the entropy none of the remaining attributes, attribute values matter, also the order of the rows don't matter (entropy is a measure for a set of elements)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) You convert the different class labels to different colors&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/A4mux.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) So instead of this table with the colored class labeled, you just draw a circle (&quot;ball&quot;) for each class label (=element)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ufvDS.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you throw all the balls in a bag. There you go! Your elements of a set are represented as balls in a bag.  If you open the bag and look into it, you might see &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;just balls of the same color --&gt; one pure color. The entropy says, it's not impure at all, I give it a zero! entropy = 0&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the same amount of balls in different colors --&gt; that doesn't look pure at all, it's impure! The entropy assigns the highest possible value to this set (bag). The highest possible entropy value depends on the number of class labels. If you have just two, the maximum entropy is 1. In your case, you have 4 different class labels, so the maximum entropy would be e.g. if you had 12 balls and 3 balls of each color. The maximum entropy of a 4 class set is 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;none of the above. Then your entropy is between the two values. If one color is dominant then the entropy will be close to 0, if the colors are very mixed up, then it is close to the maximum (2 in your case).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does a decision tree use the entropy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, first you calculate the entropy of the whole set. That impurity is your reference. What your decision tree tries to achieve is to reduce the impurity of the whole set. So the information Gain for a given attribute is computed by taking the entropy of the whole set and subtracting it with the entropies of sets that are obtained by breaking the whole set into one piece per attribute category. To make sure a set with just a few elements don't get the same weight as a set with many elements the entropies of sets are multiplied by their relative frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the example, for computing the Gain (S, parents) you need to compute the weighted entropies of the two sets: set 1 = all rows with category(parent) = yes and set 2 = all rows with category(parent) = no).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Set 1 refers to five rows, all having the decision category = cinema(just 5 orange balls!)&#xA;So the weight is 5 rows out of 10 rows = 5/10 = 0.5. And the entropy is 0 (totally pure) or by applying the formula:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/dDMBf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have a sum over all class labels so n = 4. So you assign a class label to each of the i's. E.g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 1 being cinema: - (5/5 * log(3/3) = - (1 * log(1)) = - (1*0) = 0&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 2 being tennis: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 3 being stay in: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 4 being shopping: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the sum of all four is 0. 0 times the weight 0.5 equals 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Set 2 also refers to five rows, having the decision categories = 1*cinema, 2*tennis, 1*stay in, 1*shopping&#xA;So the weight is also 5 rows out of 10 rows = 5/10 = 0.5. Applying the formula:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 1 being cinema: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 2 being tennis: - (2/5 * log(2/5) = - (0.4 * -1,32) = 0.53&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 3 being stay in: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For i = 4 being shopping: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the sum of all four is 1.92. 1.92 times the weight 0.5 = 0.96.&#xA;Thus, the Gain for this attribute is: &#xA;Initial entropy - weighted entropies for all attribute categories:&#xA;1.57 - 0 - 0.96 = 0.61.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the other attributes you do the same calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8191" LastEditorUserId="8191" LastEditDate="2015-02-11T23:38:53.957" LastActivityDate="2015-02-11T23:38:53.957" CommentCount="6" />

Whereas in Jaccard Similarity, the number of common attributes is divided by the number of attributes that exists in at least one of the two objects. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there are many other measures of similarity, each with its own eccentricities. When deciding which one to use, try to think of a few representative cases and work out which index would give the most usable results to achieve your objective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have two objects both with 10 attributes, out of a possible 100 attributes. Further they have all 10 attributes in common. In this case, the Jaccard index will be 1 and the cosine index will be 0.001. Now consider another scenario where object A has 10 attributes, and object B has 50 attributes, but B has all 10 attributes that A has. Here, Jaccard index will be 0.2 and cosine index will still be 0.001. So the key question is if that extra bit of information reflected, in this case, in the Jaccard index useful or does it hurt or does it not matter. Your choice will depend on which is the best solution for your problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cosine index could be used to identify plagiarism, but will not be a good index to identify mirror sites on the internet.

Essentially the harder the problem, the more capable and advanced tools need to be used to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be two major stages in this task: digitizing the data (image to text, i.e. OCR) and processing the data (performing the actual count). Look at them separately in order to select the best method for each stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main challenges in these images and generic OCR are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) images have low resolution. For example the # 1 image has resolution of about 72 dpi. Suggested resolution for such text quality is to scan at 300 to 400 dpi, but it is clear that re-scanning or controlling scan resolution is not applicable now. That’s why one option is to clean and increase the size using image pre-processing tools. This is what the original #1 image snippet looks like after adaptive binarization and zoomed at 300%. It is clear that each character has too few pixels and characters can be easily misread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/oNqPE.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;b) GIF format in #1 is not supported by many OCR applications. Images need to be batch-converted to a different format, such as PNG or TIF.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;c) in these scans the backgrounds and bleed-through (shadow from the text on the other side of the paper) is visible. Good binarization needs to be used to remove background and bleed-through, but not remove vital parts of actual characters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After implementing specific pre-processing solutions for the items listed above, and then using a high quality OCR system, such as www.ocr-it.com API, highest possible results can be achieved.  Result is far from perfect, but it is as high accuracy as it could be achieved with a modern OCR engine on these images.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/v5biL.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for this project, the data needs to be counted, so the second stage has all necessary data for reliable data post-processing analysis. Contrary to other basic OCR engines, the OCR provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocr-it.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.ocr-it.com&lt;/a&gt; API, which I used to produce the above recognition.  OCR-IT API is free to develop with, and very inexpensive to use per page, so that may be a very economical but powerful solution for this project.  It returns formatted text layout, including preserving line breaks and overall format structure.  This makes text post-processing easier.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A simple algorithm can be run to count the number of lines, resulting in the necessary for the research count.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above describes a two-stage approach: getting best possible OCR result, and using an applicable method to process data for the required task&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bat wait, there is more…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a second option to use an even more specialized OCR application called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wisetrend.com/abbyy-flexicapture/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FlexiCapture&lt;/a&gt; with FlexiLayout technology.  This powerful and intelligent data capture technology has built-in high-accuracy OCR, and it has a powerful rules and data analytics engine to perform very specialized user-defined chains of actions and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of this method using FlexiCapture with FlexiLayout takes the following logical steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, full page OCR is performed and all objects are extracted, including characters, noise, black horizontal and vertical lines, white gaps, and objects (which could be pictures, logos, handwriting, etc.).  This produces objects upon which we can apply our search criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, the following constraints are applied to the post-OCR data analysis and search criteria: separate image into three vertical columns and run the following logic per column, use line-start as individual count, skip header/footer/indented lines (county names), assume each name to have at least three characters, find recursively every name starting from top to bottom in every column, exclude previously found lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the above logic sounds complex to setup, the actual setup takes just a few minutes and requires minimal work through user interface (UI) environment.  No coding or programming is necessary.   The following search elements and criteria have been created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MOPHu.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RepeatingGroup consisting of a CharacterString search object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This setup produces the following search result for the first column of data:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/KzpKF.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the last step, FlexiCapture is instructed to return the number of total found elements that fit our search criteria, effectively producing the necessary data for the research task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other logic alternatives that can be setup in FlexiCapture, such as finding the number of white spaces between lines, or searching for the fixed-length fixed-placement 3-letter combinations at the end of every column linen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there are several options (which is always nice) how this task can be achieved with relative ease in effort and high quality, but the success depends on the quality of tools used and necessary knowledge how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you believe some of these tools and processes can be beneficial to your project, please contact my directly.

The aim of the Kaggle's Titanic problem is to build a &lt;strong&gt;classification&lt;/strong&gt; system that is able to predict one outcome (whether one person survived or not) given some input data. The survival table is a &lt;strong&gt;training dataset&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, a table containing a set of examples to train your system with. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, you could apply Naive Bayes to build your classification system to solve the Titanic problem. Naive Bayes is one of the simplest classification algorithms out there. It assumes that the data in your dataset has a very specific structure. Sometimes Naive Bayes can provide you with results that are good enough. Even if that is not the case, Naive Bayes may be useful as a first step; the information you obtain by analyzing Naive Bayes' results, and by further data analysis, will help you to choose which classification algorithm you could try next. Other examples of classification methods are k-nearest neighbours, neural networks, and logistic regression, but this is just a short list. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Machine Learning, I recommend you to take a look to this course from Stanford: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/ml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.coursera.org/course/ml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2576" LastActivityDate="2015-02-13T09:06:33.070" CommentCount="3" />

The only thing you need to remember is that likelihood refers to the probability of your data given a parameter. That is,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$L(\theta| X) = P(X|\theta)$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the likelihood focuses on the parameter, so you're asking &quot;What is the likelihood of this parameter given some observations?&quot; In this case, the phrase &quot;given some observation&quot; assumes the observations $X$ are fixed and the parameter $\theta$ is not fixed. On the other hand, if you describe the same in terms of probability, you're trying to measure the probability of some observations $X$ given a fixed parameter $\theta$. It is only a matter of usage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of logistic regression, the likelihood function is described as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$L(\beta| y) = \prod_{i}^{N} \pi_{i}^{y_{i}}(1-\pi_{i})^{n_{i} - y_{i}}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $\beta$ is the vector of parameters $\{\pi_{i}| i=1,...,N \}$and $y$ is the vector of Bernoulli variables. As you can see, this is the same (by definition) as $P(y|\beta)$ and that is what you have in the equation above: The product of the probabilities for each observation $y_{i}$ given its parameter $\pi_{i}$. As usual, each probability $\pi_{i}$ is equal to the inverse of the logit function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Naive Bayes, you have the same basic idea. The likelihood is defined as $L(p_{k}|x) = \prod_{i}^{N}p_{ki}^{x_{i}}(1-p_{ki})^{(1-x_{i})}$ where $p_{k}$ is a vector of parameters describing the probabilities of a class $k$ generating a word $x_{i}$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the EM algorithm, the likelihood is again $L(\theta|X,Z)$, where $\theta$ are your parameters, $X$ your observations and $Z$ are latent variables. The fact that you have a latent variables shouldn't confuse you, because this variable will be &quot;integrated out&quot;  in the expectation step of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous equations, the calculation you need to do is self-evident if you think about it starting from your observations: First, I have some observations. Then I want to calculate the probability of obtaining these observation using some model. Most models require parameters to be fitted. So I want to calculate the probability of these observations given those parameters. That is, $p(X|\theta)$.

Essentially, it would be a simple look-up table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You tell the model what attributes each piece of data has and it simply remembers it and does nothing more with it. If you give it a piece of data that it's seen before, it looks it up and simply regurgitates what you told it earlier. If you give it data it &lt;em&gt;hasn't&lt;/em&gt; seen before, the outcome is unpredictable or random. But the point of machine learning isn't to tell you what happened, it's to understand the patterns and use those patterns to predict what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So think of a decision tree. If you keep growing your decision tree bigger and bigger, eventually you'll wind up with a tree in which every leaf node is based on exactly one data point. You've just found a backdoor way of creating a look-up table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to generalize your results to figure out what might happen in the future, you must create a model that generalizes what's going on in your training set. Overfit models do a great job of describing the data you already have, but descriptive models are not necessarily predictive models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The No Free Lunch Theorem says that no model can outperform any other model on the set of all &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; instances. If you want to predict what will come next in the sequence of numbers &quot;2, 4, 16, 32&quot; you can't build a model more accurate than any other if you don't make the assumption that there's an underlying pattern. A model that's overfit isn't really evaluating the patterns - it's simply modeling what it knows is possible and giving you the observations. You get predictive power by assuming that there is some underlying function and that if you can determine what that function is, you can predict the outcome of events. But if there really is no pattern, then you're out of luck and all you can hope for is a look-up table to tell you what you know is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8104" LastActivityDate="2015-02-14T22:45:50.003" CommentCount="0" />

Considering the case when you have to classify an observation (instance) whih is identical with one observation from the 'learned' data set, than the inverse distance is not defined by a direct formula since you have to divide by zero. But considering the math behind, inverse of the zero distance is positive infinity. Which means that, the weight for the identical point would dominate all other weights of the data instances. Thus the classification for that specific point could be taken as the class of the identical observation from the data set. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand the inverse of the euclidean distance is only one type of distance. You can always apply a kernel function on that to weight non-uniformly the contributions. For example you can choose a normal density with mean equals zero and variance equals 1.

The established practice is to keep projects isolated from each other as far as their dependencies are concerned.

This approach overcomes several limitations of ILP and (&lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.225.4755&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according to some scholars, at least&lt;/a&gt;) is as suitable for application in terms of representation and has the benefit of allowing problems to be expressed in a more natural way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without knowing more about the specifics of your database and the barriers you face to using ILP, I can't know if this solves your problem or suffers from the same problems.

Actually, if &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; N gets scheduled and the only question is which M it gets, the outputs are lists which channel (or none) is scheduled to each block, and there is only a certain possible number of those, so you can model them as discrete outputs (classes) with their own probabilities.

I think you will quickly learn about the general behavior of the scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the scheduler has a memory, then things get complicated.

Also, don't make the mistake of using the serial number in your machine learning algorithms! The reason why I'm suggesting regression as opposed to 'better' machine learning algorithms is because you said you wanted to learn, and it's important to understand the algorithms (for the long run, and to truly be good at this stuff) that you're using. Regression is the easiest tool in the book that works quite well! Weka is so easy to use that you'll be able to plug and play different machine learning algorithms just for the sake of it. Another pointer that's won me several competitions is to do some feature selection before using regression/machine learning. For example, in your case, it is reasonable to assume that a student who scores high in Physics probably has a better chance of scoring high in Math as opposed to someone who scores high in English (but not necessarily Physics). If you have enough data, the algorithm itself will be able to deduce these positive/negative correlations and train the model accordingly. Sometimes, there isn't enough data, and you have to do some feature selection. Good luck! I'm a regular participant on Kaggle myself, and I think it's great that you're taking the 'hacker' route to learn more. It's the best way to get your hands dirty on real data and engineering problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8395" LastActivityDate="2015-02-28T17:21:46.300" CommentCount="0" />

The first is a scalar quantity and theoretically the latter two can either be discrete or continuous. The convergence proofs and analyses of the various algorithms are easier to understand for the discrete case and also the corresponding algorithms are easier to code. That is one of the reasons, most introductory material focuses on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, it should be interesting to note that the early research on Reinforcement Learning actually focussed on continuous state representations.

So, as long as you preserve orde, the decision trees are the same (obviously by the same tree here I understand the same decision structure, not the same values for each test in each node of the tree). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why it happens is because how usual impurity functions works. In order to find the best split it searches on each dimension (attribute) a split point which is basically an if clause which groups target values corresponding to instances which has test value less than split value, and on the right the values greater than equal. This happens for numerical attributes (which I think is your case because I do not know how to normalize a nominal attribute). Now you might note that the criteria is less than or greater than. Which means that the real information from the attributes in order to find the split (and the whole tree) is only the order of the values. Which means that as long as you transform your attributes in such a way that the original ordering is reserved, you will get the same tree. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not all models are insensitive to such kind of transformation. For example linear regression models give the same results if you multiply an attribute with something different than zero. You will get different regression coefficients, but the predicted value will be the same. This is not the case when you take a log of that transformation. So for linear regression, for example, normalizing is useless since it will provide the same result. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However this is not the case with a penalized linear regression, like ridge regression. In penalized linear regressions a constraint is applied to coefficients. The idea is that the constraint is applied to the sum  of a function of coefficients. Now if you inflate an attribute, the coefficient will be deflated, which means that in the end the penalization for that coefficient it will be artificially modified. In such kind of situation, you normalize attributes in order that each coefficient to be constraint 'fairly'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2015-03-04T12:15:10.117" CommentCount="1" />

Each column of your matrix corresponds to a &quot;source node&quot; in the left part of the bipartite graph $BP(L, R)$; each row of the matrix corresponds to a &quot;destination node&quot; in the right part $R$. Capacity of each source node is the corresponding column's sum; similarly, capacities are defined for the destinations via row sums. Value $a_{ij}$ in the matrix describes flow of mass from $j$'th source to $i$'th destination along an existing edge $(j \to i)$ of $BP$. Your initially given 0-1 matrix describes which edges are present (e.g., the matrix in your example prescribes the edge $(3, 2)$ to be absent from the network, along with all self-loops). If you denote $F$ to be the sum of all column sums (or, alternatively, the total capacity of all sources), then your problem narrows down to finding a max-flow from $L$ to $R$ in $BP$ and checking whether the volume of the discovered flow equals $F$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note 1 (Feasibility):&lt;/em&gt; Before plunging into finding best flows, you may want to check your row sums: a necessary condition for your problem to have a solution is that the sum of all column sums (which is $N$ in your particular case of a column-stochastic matrix) should be equal the sum of row sums, as both numbers describe the same -- the sum of all elements of the target matrix. (For example, for $N = 3$ and the vector of row sums from your example, the problem is unfeasible.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note 2 (Upper bound):&lt;/em&gt; Since $a_{ij}$ describes the flow from $j$'th source, and the capacities of all sources are 1 in your setting, then each source cannot send more than 1 unit of mass to a single destination. Thus, each $a_{ij}$ will not exceed 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note 3 (Lower bound):&lt;/em&gt; To make $a_{ij}$ for each existing edge $(j \to i)$ strictly positive, you can augment the max-flow problem with lower bounds on edge capacities. In a general setting, edge capacity bounds are $0$ and $+\infty$. You may want to replace the lower bound with some positive number, small enough not to interfere with the discovery of the best flow and large enough to satisfy your edge saturation needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8462" LastActivityDate="2015-03-06T05:45:03.720" CommentCount="0" />

  <row Id="5292" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2015-03-06T10:28:04.483" Score="1" ViewCount="17" Body="&lt;p&gt;I have a huge collection of objects from which only a tiny fraction are in a class of interest. The collection is initially unlabelled, but labels can be added using an expensive operation (for example, by human).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently I use the simple generic machine learning strategy:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use hand-crafted rules to select a smaller subset of objects (thus leaving out a fraction of interesting ones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Label part of the smaller subset, and use these for training and choosing a classification algorithm and its parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classify the remaining objects in the smaller set (and also perhaps in the big set).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has two drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The labeller still needs to see a huge number of uninteresting objects, and therefore is able to label only a very small fraction of interesting ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objects not in the smaller set are completely ignored in the learning phase, resulting in a loss of some information (the classification algorithm might not work well on this complement).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that it would be better to use online learning: i.e., select the objects to show to the labeller based on the previous labels. But then it becomes no longer obvious that the result of classification algorithm retains the nice theoretical properties (i.e., statistical consistency).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a general framework for active object detection which works either theoretically or practically (or both)? I could not get the complete picture from the Wikipedia article &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_%28machine_learning%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;active learning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6550" LastActivityDate="2015-03-06T10:28:04.483" Title="Generic strategy for object detection" Tags="&lt;machine-learning&gt;&lt;classification&gt;&lt;object-recognition&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="0" />
