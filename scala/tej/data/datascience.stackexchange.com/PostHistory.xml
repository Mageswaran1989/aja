Once you pick a framework that allows modelling of your situation, you then see which elements are &quot;fixed&quot; and which are flexible. For example, the model may allow you to define your own network structure (or even learn it) with certain constraints. You have to decide whether this flexibility is sufficient for your purposes. Then within a particular network structure, you can learn parameters given a specific training dataset.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You rarely hard-code behavior in AI/ML solutions. It's all about modelling the underlying situation and accommodating different situations by tweaking elements of the model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your example, perhaps you might have the robot learn how to detect obstacles (by analyzing elements in the environment), or you might have it keep track of where the obstacles were and which way they were moving." />

Generally, though, I'd say you're certainly dealing with big data if the scale is such that it's no longer feasible to manage with more traditional technologies such as RDBMS, at least without complementing them with big data technologies such as Hadoop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How big your data has to actually be for that to be the case is debatable.  Here's a (somewhat provocative) [blog post][1] that claims that it's not really the case for less than 5 TB of data.  (To be clear, it doesn't claim &quot;Less than 5 TB isn't big data&quot;, but just &quot;Less than 5 TB isn't big enough that you need Hadoop&quot;.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But even on smaller datasets, big data technologies like Hadoop can have other advantages, including being well suited to batch operations, playing well with unstructured data (as well as data whose structure isn't known in advance or could change), horizontal scalability (scaling by adding more nodes instead of beefing up your existing servers), and (as one of the commenters on the above-linked post notes) the ability to integrate your data processing with external data sets (think of a map-reduce where the mapper makes a call to another server).  Other technologies associated with big data, like NoSql databases, emphasize fast performance and consistent availability while dealing with large sets of data, as well also being able to handle semi-unstructured data and to scale horizontally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, traditional RDBMS have their own advantages including ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and better performance for certain operations, as well as being more standardized, more mature, and (for many users) more familiar.  So even for indisputably &quot;big&quot; data, it may make sense to load at least a portion of your data into a traditional SQL database and use that in conjunction with big data technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, a more generous definition would be that you have big data so long as it's big enough that big data technologies provide some added value for you.  But as you can see, that can depend not just on the size of your data but on how you want to work with it and what sort of requirements you have in terms of flexibility, consistency, and performance.  *How* you're using your data is more relevant to the question than what you're using it *for* (e.g. data mining).  That said, uses like data mining and machine learning are more likely to yield useful results if you have a big enough data set to work with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html" />

Relational Databases require 'pristine data'. If the data is in the database, it is accurate, clean, and 100% reliable. Relational Databases require &quot;Great Data&quot;  and a huge amount of time, money, and accountability is put on to making sure the data is well prepared before loading it in to the database.

The first part, let us call it *soft preprocessing*, could be taken as the usage of different data mining algorithms to preprocess data in such a way that makes it suitable for further analyses. Notice that this could be the analysis itself, in case the goal is simple enough to be tackled in a single shot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second part, the *hard preprocessing*, actually comes prior to any other process, and is may be taken as the usage of simple tools or scripts to clean up data, selecting specific contents to be processed. To this problem, POSIX provides us with a wonderous set of magic tools, which can be used to compose concise -- and very powerful -- preprocessing scripts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, for people who deal with data coming from social websites (twitter, facebook, ...), the *data retrieval* usually yields files with very specific format -- although not always nicely structure, as they may contain missing fields, and so. For these cases, a simple `awk` script could clean up the data, producing a *valid* input file for later processing. From the magic set, one may also point out `grep`, `sed`, `cut`, `join`, `paste`, `sort`, and a whole multitude of other tools.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In case simple the source file has too many nitty-gritties, it may also be necessary to produce a bundle of methods to clean up data. In such cases, it is usually better to use scripting languages (other than shell ones), such as Python, Ruby, and Perl. This allows for building up *API*'s to select specific data in a very straightforward and reusable way. Such *API*'s are sometimes made public by their writers, such as [IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/), [Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs), and many others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, answering the question: are there any best practices? It usually depends on your task. If you will always deal with the same data format, it's commonly best to write an *organized* script to preprocess it; whereas, if you just need a simple and fast clean up on some dataset, count on POSIX tools for concise shell scripts that will do the whole job **much** faster than a Python script, or so. Since the *clean up* depends both on the dataset and on your purposes, it's hard to have everything already done. Yet, there are lots of API's that puts you halfway through with the problem." />

To make it more straightforward, consider the following example: you're hired by some scientists to provide them with a model to predict the growth of some kind of plants. The scientists have given you information collected from their work &#xD;&#xA;with such plants throughout a whole year, and they shall continuously give you information on the future development of their plantation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you run through the data received, and build up a model out of it. Now suppose that, in your model, you considered just as many characteristics as possible to always find out the exact behavior of the plants you saw in the initial dataset. Now, as the production continues, you'll always take into account those characteristics, and will produce very *fine-grained* results. However, if the plantation eventually suffer from some seasonal change, the results you will receive may fit your model in such a way that your predictions will begin to fail (either saying that the growth will slow down, while it shall actually speed up, or the opposite).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from being unable to detect such small variations, and to usually classify your entries incorrectly, the *fine-grain* on the model, i.e., the great amount of variables, may cause the processing to be too costly. Now, imagine that your data is already complex.

Querying, or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; traversing, the graph involves following paths. Because of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fundamentally path-oriented nature of the datamodel, the majority of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; path-based graph database operations are highly aligned with the way&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in which the data is laid out, making them extremely efficient. In&#xD;&#xA;&gt; their book Neo4j in Action, Partner and Vukotic perform an experiment&#xD;&#xA;&gt; using a relational store and Neo4j.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The comparison shows that the graph database is substantially quicker&#xD;&#xA;&gt; for connected data than a relational store.Partner and Vukotic’s&#xD;&#xA;&gt; experiment seeks to find friends-of-friends in a social network, to a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; maximum depth of five. Given any two persons chosen at random, is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there a path that connects them which is at most five relationships&#xD;&#xA;&gt; long? For a social network containing 1,000,000 people, each with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; approximately 50 friends, the results strongly suggest that graph&#xD;&#xA;&gt; databases are the best choice for connected data, as we see in Table&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2-1.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Table 2-1. Finding extended friends in a relational database versus efficient finding in Neo4j&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     Depth   RDBMS Execution time (s)    Neo4j Execution time (s)     Records returned&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     2	      0.016                       0.01	                       ~2500	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     3	      30.267                      0.168	                       ~110,000	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     4	      1543.505	                  1.359	                       ~600,000	&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     5	      Unfinished	              2.132	                       ~800,000&#xD;&#xA;At depth two (friends-of-friends) both the relational database and the graph database perform well enough for us to consider using them in an online system. While the Neo4j query runs in two-thirds the time of the relational one, an end-user would barely notice the the difference in milliseconds between the two. By the time we reach depth three (friend-of-friend-of-friend), however, it’s clear that the relational database can no longer deal with the query in a reasonable timeframe: the thirty seconds it takes to complete would be completely unacceptable for an online system. In contrast, Neo4j’s response time remains relatively flat: just a fraction of a second to perform the query—definitely quick enough for an online system.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; At depth four the relational database exhibits crippling latency,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; making it practically useless for an online system. Neo4j’s timings&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have deteriorated a little too, but the latency here is at the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; periphery of being acceptable for a responsive online system. Finally,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at depth five, the relational database simply takes too long to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; complete the query. Neo4j, in contrast, returns a result in around two&#xD;&#xA;&gt; seconds. At depth five, it transpires almost the entire network is our&#xD;&#xA;&gt; friend: for many real-world use cases, we’d likely trim the results,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and the timings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Questions are:** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Is this a reasonable test to emulate what one might except to find in a social network? *(Meaning do real social networks normally have nodes with approximately 50 friends for example; seems like the &quot;[rich get richer][3]&quot; model would be more natural for social networks, though might be wrong.)*&#xD;&#xA; - Regardless of the naturalness of the emulation, is there any reason to believe the results are off, or unreproducible? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/Graph-Databases-Ian-Robinson/dp/1449356265&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.amazon.com/Neo4j-Action-Jonas-Partner/dp/1617290769/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_rich_get_richer_%28statistics%29" />

So one machine can delegate to 100 to each get a part of the result and then combine them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also get away with some degree of approximation. Google does not literally form a thousand pages of search results; it just has to get the first page about right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that Google has _millions_ of computers around the globe.

For example, you might use the Holm–Bonferroni method.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of a large sample rather than a lot of variables, something else is needed.  As Christopher said, magnitude of effect a way to treat this.  Combining these two ideas, you might use a confidence interval around your magnitude of effect, and apply a false discovery rate correction to the p-value of the confidence interval.  The effects for which even the lowest bound of the corrected confidence interval is high are likely to be strong effects, regardless of huge data set size.  I am not aware of any published paper that combines confidence intervals with false discovery rate correction in this way, but it seems like a straightforward and intuitively understandable approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make this even better, use a non-parametric way to estimate confidence intervals.  Assuming a distribution is likely to give very optimistic estimates here, and even fitting a distribution to the data is likely to be inaccurate.  Since the information about the shape of the distribution past the edges of the confidence interval comes from a relatively small subsample of the data, this is where it really pays to be careful.  You can use bootstrapping to get a non-parametric confidence interval.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familywise_error_rate" />

You can, by various methods, project behavior and counts into the unstable group.  The above is a simple example of something you might want to know.  The general idea is again to define a set of users you are confident persist, measure what you want to measure, and use certain ground truths (num searches, visits, clicks, etc...) to project into the unknown user space and estimate counts for them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a longstanding problem in unique user counting, logging, etc... for services that don't require log in." />

The scientists have given you information collected from their work &#xD;&#xA;with such plants throughout a whole year, and they shall continuously give you information on the future development of their plantation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you run through the data received, and build up a model out of it. Now suppose that, in your model, you considered just as many characteristics as possible to always find out the exact behavior of the plants you saw in the initial dataset. Now, as the production continues, you'll always take into account those characteristics, and will produce very *fine-grained* results.

But here are important things to take into account, and that make it *feasible* to have such low latency on queries from all these TBs of data in different machines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. distributed computing: by being distributed does not mean that the indexes are simply distributed in different machines, they are actually replicated along different clusters, which allows for lots of users performing different queries with low retrieval time (yes, huge companies can afford for that much of machines);&#xD;&#xA;2. caching: caches tremendously reduce execution time, be it for the crawling step, for the retrieval of pages, or for the ranking and exihibition of results;&#xD;&#xA;3. lots of tweaking: all the above and very efficient algorithms/solutions can only be effective if the implementation is also efficient. There are tons of (hard coded) optimizations, such as locality of reference, compression, caching; all of them usually appliable to different parts of the processing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Considering that, lets try to address your questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; but I imagine it infeasible for the results of every single possible query to be indexed&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, it would be, and actually is infeasible to have results for *every single possible query*. There is an infinite number of terms in the world (even if you assume that only terms properly spelled will be entered), and there is an exponential number of queries from these `n -&gt; inf` terms (`2^n`). So what is done? Caching. But if there are so many queries/results, which ones to cache? Caching policies. The most frequent/popular/relevant-for-the-user queries are the ones cached.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; wouldn't the hardware latency in Google's hardware be huge? Even if the data in Google were all stored in TB/s SSDs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nowdays, with such highly developed processors, people tend to think that every possible task that must finish within a second (or less), and that deals with so much data, must be processed by extremely powerful processors with multiple cores and lots of memory. However, the one thing *ruling* market is money, and the investors are not interested in wasting it. So what is done?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The preference is actually for having lots of machines, each using simple/accessible (in terms of cost) processors, which lowers the price of building up the multitude of clusters there are. And yes, it does work. The main bottleneck always boils down to disk, if you consider simple measurements of [performance](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uf6al.gif). But once there are so many machines, one can afford to load things up to main memory, instead of working on hard disks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Memory cards are *expensive* for us, mere human beings, but they are very cheap for enterprises that buy lots of such cards at once. Since it's not costly, having much memory as needed to load indexes and keep caches at hand is not a problem. And since there are so many machines, there is no need for super fast processors, as you can direct queries to different places, and have clusters of machines responsible for attending *specific geographical regions*, which allows for more *specialized* data caching, and even better response times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does MapReduce help solve this problem?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although I don't think that using or not MapReduce is restricted information inside Google, I'm not conversant about this point. However, Google's implementation of MapReduce (which is surely *not* Hadoop) must have lots of optimizations, many involving the aspects discussed above. So, the architecture of MapReduce probably helps guiding how the computations are physically distributed, but there are many other points to be considered to justify such speed in querying time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Okay, so I understand that popular searches can be cached in memory.

But here are important things to take into account, and that make it *feasible* to have such low latency on queries from all these TBs of data in different machines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. distributed computing: by being distributed does not mean that the indexes are simply distributed in different machines, they are actually replicated along different clusters, which allows for lots of users performing different queries with low retrieval time (yes, huge companies can afford for that much of machines);&#xD;&#xA;2. caching: caches tremendously reduce execution time, be it for the crawling step, for the retrieval of pages, or for the ranking and exihibition of results;&#xD;&#xA;3. lots of tweaking: all the above and very efficient algorithms/solutions can only be effective if the implementation is also efficient. There are tons of (hard coded) optimizations, such as locality of reference, compression, caching; all of them usually appliable to different parts of the processing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Considering that, lets try to address your questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; but I imagine it infeasible for the results of every single possible query to be indexed&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, it would be, and actually is infeasible to have results for *every single possible query*. There is an infinite number of terms in the world (even if you assume that only terms properly spelled will be entered), and there is an exponential number of queries from these `n -&gt; inf` terms (`2^n`). So what is done? Caching. But if there are so many queries/results, which ones to cache? Caching policies. The most frequent/popular/relevant-for-the-user queries are the ones cached.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; wouldn't the hardware latency in Google's hardware be huge? Even if the data in Google were all stored in TB/s SSDs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nowdays, with such highly developed processors, people tend to think that every possible task that must finish within a second (or less), and that deals with so much data, must be processed by extremely powerful processors with multiple cores and lots of memory. However, the one thing *ruling* market is money, and the investors are not interested in wasting it. So what is done?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The preference is actually for having lots of machines, each using simple/accessible (in terms of cost) processors, which lowers the price of building up the multitude of clusters there are. And yes, it does work. The main bottleneck always boils down to disk, if you consider simple measurements of [performance](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uf6al.gif). But once there are so many machines, one can afford to load things up to main memory, instead of working on hard disks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Memory cards are *expensive* for us, mere human beings, but they are very cheap for enterprises that buy lots of such cards at once. Since it's not costly, having much memory as needed to load indexes and keep caches at hand is not a problem. And since there are so many machines, there is no need for super fast processors, as you can direct queries to different places, and have clusters of machines responsible for attending *specific geographical regions*, which allows for more *specialized* data caching, and even better response times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does MapReduce help solve this problem?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although I don't think that using or not MapReduce is restricted information inside Google, I'm not conversant about this point. However, Google's implementation of MapReduce (which is surely *not* Hadoop) must have lots of optimizations, many involving the aspects discussed above. So, the architecture of MapReduce probably helps guiding how the computations are physically distributed, but there are many other points to be considered to justify such speed in querying time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Okay, so I understand that popular searches can be cached in memory.

Orient is a Graph-Document database server written entirely in Java. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In graph databases, relationships are considered first class citizens and therefore traversing those relationships can be done pretty quickly. Orient is also a document database which would allow you the kind of schema-free architecture it sounds like you would need. The real reason I suggest Orient, however, is because of its extensiblity. It supports streaming via sockets, and the entire database can be embedded into another application. Finally, it can be scaled efficiently and/or can work entirely through memory. So, with some Java expertise, you can actually run your preset queries against the database in memory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We are doing something similar. In creating an app/site for social science research collaboration, we found ourselves with immensely complex data models. We ended up writing several of the queries using the Gremlin Traversal Language (a subset of Groovy, which is, of course, Java at its heart), and then exposing those queries through the binary connection server of the OrientDB. So, the client opens a TCP socket, sends a short binary message, and the query is executing in Java directly against the in-memory database.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;OrientDB also supports writing function queries in Javascript, and you can use Node.js to interact directly with an Orient instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For something of this size, I would want to use Orient in conjunction with Hadoop or something like that.

The idea here is that you have a user/item matrix and for some of the users you have a reported age.  The age for a person in the user item matrix might be well determined by something like the mean or median age of some nearest neighbors in the item space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So you have each user expressed as a vector in item space, find the k nearest neighbors and assign the vector in question some summary stat of the nearest neighbor ages.  You can choose k on a distance cutoff or more realistically by iteratively assigning ages to a train hold out and choosing the k that minimizes the error in that assignment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the dimensionality is a problem you can easily perform reduction in this setup by single value decomposition choosing the m vectors that capture the most variance across the group.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all cases since each feature is binary it seems that cosine similarity would be your go to distance metric.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I need to think a bit more about other approaches (regression, rf, etc...) given the narrow focus of your feature space (all variants of the same action, liking) I think the user/item approach might be the best.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One note of caution, if the ages you have for train are self reported you might need to correct some of them.

However, this requires considerable investment on preparing the platform (software and hardware) and educating the team to work with Hadoop and write map-reduce tasks for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Another approach is to just put our effort on designing the map-reduce algorithms, and run the algorithms on MongoDB map-reduce functionalities.

As an evidence, in a data mining course in my university, the best final project was written in Python, although the others has access to R's rich data analysis library. That is, sometimes the overall productivity (considering learning materials, documentation, etc.) for Python may be better than R even in the lack of special-purpose data analysis libraries for Python.

Considering parallel processes, the code executed is the same, regardless of the level of parallelism (instruction, data, task). You write a *single code*, and it will be executed by different threads/processors, e.g., while computing matrices products, or generating permutations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, distributed computing involves the execution of different algorithms/programs at the same time in different processors (from one or more machines). Such computations are later merged into a intermediate/final results by using the available means of data communication/synchronization (shared memory, network). Further, distributed computing is very appealing for BigData processing, as it allows for exploiting disk parallelism (usually the bottleneck for large databases).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, for the level of parallelism, it may be taken rather as a constraint on the synchronization. For example, in GPGPU, which is single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD), the parallelism occurs by having different inputs for a single instruction, each pair *(data_i, instruction)* being executed by a different thread. Such is the restraint that, in case of divergent branches, it is necessary to discard lots of unnecessary computations, until the threads reconverge. For CPU threads, though, they commonly diverge; yet, one may use synchronization structures to grant concurrent execution of specific sections of the code." />

From personal experience, there are some databases that can't be made publicly available, either for involving privacy restraints (as for some social network informations), or for concerning government information (like health system databases).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point concerns the usage/application of the dataset. Although some bases can be reprocessed to suit the needs of the application, it would be great to have some *nice organization* of the datasets by purpose. The *taxonomy* should involve social graph analysis, itemset mining, classification, and lots of other reasearch areas there may be." />

For us, [tag:data-science] is more about testing a hypothesis, and typically the data have been collected just for that purpose. [tag:data-mining] is more about sifting through existing data, looking for structure, and perhaps generating hypotheses. Data mining can start with a hypothesis, but it's often very weak or general, and can be difficult to resolve with confidence.

Without further details, all documents are split in tokens (terms), and for each term is maintained a data structure, which stores all the documents which contains the given term.

In this case the most often setup I use is one hot encoding. You will have K output columns, and in the training set you will set all values to 0, except the one which has the category index, which could have value 1. Thus, for each training data set instance you will have all outputs with values 0 or 1, all outputs sum to 1 for each instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This looks like a probability, which reminds me of a technique used often to connect some outputs which are modeled as probability. This is called softmax function, more details [on Wikipedia][1]. This will allow you to put some constraints on the output values (it is basically a logistic function generalization) so that the output values will be modeled as probabilities. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, with or without softmax you can use the output as a discriminant function to select the proper category.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another final thought would be to avoid to encode you variables in a connected way. For example you can have the binary representation of the category index. This would induce to the learner an artificial connection between some outputs which are arbitrary. The one hot encoding has the advantage that is neutral to how labels are indexed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_activation_function" />

We can denote the parameters of the Dirichlet as a vector of size K of the form ~ 1/B(a) * Product(x_i ^ (a_i-1)), where a is the vector of size K of the parameters, and sum of x_i = 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now the LDA uses some constructs like:&#xD;&#xA;- a document can have multiple topics (because of this multiplicity, we need the Dirichlet distribution); and there is a Dirichlet distribution which models this relation&#xD;&#xA;- words can also belong to multiple topics, when you consider them outside of a document; so here we need another Dirichlet to model this&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The previous two are distributions which you do not really see from data, this is why is called latent, or hidden.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, in Bayesian inference you use the Bayes rule to infer the posterior probability. For simplicity, let's say you have data *x* and you have a model for this data governed by some parameters theta. In order to infer values for this parameters, in full Bayesian inference you will infer the posterior probability of these parameters using Bayes' rule with *p(theta|x) = p(x|theta)p(theta|alpha)/p(x|alpha)*. In plain words is *posterior probability = likelihood x prior probability / marginal likelihood*. Note that here comes an *alpha*. This is your initial belief about this distribution, and is the parameter of the prior distribution. Usually this is chosen in such a way that will have a conjugate prior (so the distribution of the posterior is the same with the distribution of the prior) and often to encode some knowledge if you have one or to have maximum entropy if you know nothing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The parameters of the prior are called *hyperparameters*. So, in LDA, both topic distributions, over documents and over words have also correspondent priors, which are denoted usually with alpha and beta, and because are the parameters of the prior distributions are called hyperparameters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now about choosing priors. If you plot some Dirichlet distributions you will note that if the individual parameters *alpha_k* have the same value, the pdf is symmetric in the simplex defined by the *x* values, which is the minimum or maximum for pdf is at the center. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If all the alpha_k have values lower than unit the maximum is found at corners&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5khZE.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or can if all values alpha_k are the same and greater than 1 the maximum will be found in center like &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/prmlfigs-png/Figure2.5c.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is easy to see that if values for alpha_k are not equal the symmetry is broken and the maximum will be found near bigger values. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additional, please note that values for priors parameters produce smooth pdfs of the distribution as the values of the parameters are near 1. So if you have great confidence that something is clearly distributed in a way you know, with a high degree of confidence, than values far from 1 in absolute value are to be used, if you do not have such kind of knowledge than values near 1 would be encode this lack of knowledge. It is easy to see why 1 plays such a role in Dirichlet distribution from the formula of the distribution itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another way to understand this is to see that prior encode prior-knowledge. In the same time you might think that prior encode some prior seen data. This data was not saw by the algorithm itself, it was saw by you, you learned something, and you can model prior according to what you know (learned). So in the prior parameters (hyperparameters) you encode also how big this data set you apriori saw, because the sum of alpha_k can be that also as the size of this more or less imaginary data set. So the bigger the prior data set, the bigger is the confidence, the bigger the values of alpha_k you can choose, the sharper the surface near maximum value, which means also less doubts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope it helped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PS: It's a hell to write something without LaTeX notation.

If you can analyze the ages of a user's friends, the age of the user will almost certainly be within a year or two of the median among his or her friends, particularly if the users are young enough to have built their friend networks while still in school (since most will be classmates). That prediction would likely trump any you would get from modeling---this is a textbook example of a problem where the right data &gt; the right model every time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck!&#xD;&#xA;" />

It's usually more efficient to have N servers of a certain capacity than 2N servers of half that capacity. More of the data access will be local, and therefore fast in memory versus slow across the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At a certain point, scaling up one machine becomes uneconomical because the cost of additional resource scales more than linearly. However this point is still amazingly high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On Amazon in particular though, the economics of each instance type can vary a lot if you are using spot market instances. The default pricing more or less means that the same amount of resource costs about the same regardless of the instance type, that can vary a lot; large instances can be cheaper than small ones, or N small instances can be much cheaper than one large machine with equivalent resources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One massive consideration here is that the computation paradigm can change quite a lot when you move from one machine to multiple machines. The tradeoffs that the communication overhead induce may force you to, for example, adopt a data-parallel paradigm to scale. That means a different choice of tools and algorithm. For example, SGD looks quite different in-memory and in Python than on MapReduce. So you would have to consider this before parallelizing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may choose to distribute work across a cluster, even if a single node and non-distributed paradigms work for you, for reliability. If a single node fails, you lose all of the computation; a distributed computation can potentially recover and complete just the part of the computation that was lost." />

This is straightforward within a single analytics or stats platform---be it Python, R, Stata, etc.---but I'm curious where best to locate this step in a multi-platform workflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's simple enough to do this in Python, either with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#imputation-of-missing-values&quot;&gt;`sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer`&lt;/a&gt; class, using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html&quot;&gt;`pandas.DataFrame.fillna`&lt;/a&gt; method, or by hand (depending upon the complexity of the imputation method used). But since I'm going to be using this for dozens or hundreds of columns across hundreds of millions of records, I wonder if there's a more efficient way to do this directly through SQL ahead of time. Aside from the potential efficiencies of doing this in a distributed platform like Vertica, this would have the added benefit of allowing us to create an automated pipeline for building &quot;complete&quot; versions of tables, so we don't need to fill in a new set of missing values from scratch every time we want to run a model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't been able to find much guidance about this, but I imagine that we could:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. create a table of substitute values (e.g., mean/median/mode, either overall or by group) for each incomplete column&#xD;&#xA; 2. join the substitute value table with the original table to assign a substitute value for each row and incomplete column&#xD;&#xA; 3. use a series of case statements to take the original value if available and the substitute value otherwise&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this a reasonable thing to do in Vertica/SQL, or is there a good reason not to bother and just handle it in Python instead?

I often wasted time trying to automate this things, destroying my data. I will give you some examples:&#xD;&#xA;- a marketplace encoded as N/A, which I missed and considered to be North/America&#xD;&#xA;- numbers like -999.0, because the data producer could not find a better replacement for missing data&#xD;&#xA;- number like 0 for blood pressure or body temperature, instead of missing data (it is hard to imagine a living human with 0 blood pressure)&#xD;&#xA;- multiple placeholders for missing data, due to the fact that the data was collected from various sources&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After that you need to understand what kind of imputation would resemble better the information from your data for a given task.

In fact, most frameworks have some sort of core infrastructure around which a core layer of basic functionality is implemented.  More specific functionality makes use of the basic layer and is placed in a second layer around the core.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now by shortcuts I mean going straight from a second layer routine to another second layer routine without using the core.  Typical example (from my domain) would be timestamps: You have a timestamped data source of some kind.  Thus far the job is simply to read the data off the wire and pass it to the core so your other code can feast on it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now your industry changes the default timestamp format for a very good reason (in my case they went from unix time to GPS time).  Unless your framework is industry-specific it is very unlikely that they're willing to change the core representation of time, so you end up using a framework that *almost* does what you want.  Every time you access your data you have to convert it to industry-time-format first, and every time you want it modified you have to convert it back to whatever the core deems appropriate.  There is no way that you can hand over data straight from the source to a sink without double conversion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where your hand-crafted frameworks will shine, it's just a minor change and you're back modelling the real world whereas all other (non-industry-specific) frameworks will now have a performance disadvantage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over time, the discrepancy between the real world and the model will add up.  With an off-the-shelf framework you'd soon be facing questions like: How can I represent `this` in `that` or how do make routine `X` accept/produce `Y`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So far this wasn't about C/C++.  But if, for some reason, you can't change the framework, i.e. you do have to put up with double conversion of data to go from one end to another, then you'd typically employ something that minimises the additional overhead.  In my case, a TAI-&gt;UTC or UTC-&gt;TAI converter is best left to raw C (or an FPGA).  There is no elegance possible, no profound smart data structure that makes the problem trivial.  It's just a boring switch statement, and why not use a language whose compilers are good at optimising exactly that?&#xD;&#xA;" />

You could apply machine learning algorithms, analyze it using visualizations, combine it with external data about the region, ethnic makeup, changes to environment over time, political information, weather patterns, etc.  All of that would be &quot;data science&quot; in my opinion.  It might take something like hadoop to test and apply anything you learned to data comprising an entire country of students rather than just a classroom, but that final step doesn't necessarily make someone a data scientist.  And not taking that final step doesn't necessarily disqualify someone from being a data scientist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

When you repeat classification tests you will end up having multiple confusion matrices. The question is how to get a meaningful aggregate confusion matrix. The answer depends on what is the meaning of meaningful (pun intended). I think there is not a single version of meaningful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way is to follow the rough idea of multiple testing. In general, you test something multiple times in order to get more accurate results. As a general principle one can reason that averaging on the results of the multiple tests reduces the variance of the estimates, so as a consequence, it increases the precision of the estimates. You can proceed in this way, of course, by summing position by position and then dividing by the number of tests. You can go further and instead of estimating only a value for each cell of the confusion matrix, you can also compute some confidence intervals, t-values and so on. This is OK from my point of view. But it tell only one side of the story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other side of the story which might be investigated is how stable are the results for the same instances. To exemplify that I will take an extreme example. Suppose you have a classification model for 3 classes. Suppose that these classes are in the same proportion. If your model is able to predict one class perfectly and the other 2 classes with random like performance, you will end up having 0.33 + 0.166 + 0.166 = 0.66 misclassification ratio. This might seem good, but even if you take a look on a single confusion matrix you will not know that your performance on the last 2 classes varies wildly. Multiple tests can help. But averaging the confusion matrices would reveal this? My belief is not. The averaging will give the same result more or less, and doing multiple tests will only decrease the variance of the estimation. However it says nothing about the wild instability of prediction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So another way to do compose the confusion matrices would better involve a prediction density for each instance. One can build this density by counting for each instance, the number of times it was predicted a given class. After normalization, you will have for each instance a prediction density rather a single prediction label. You can see that a single prediction label is similar with a degenerated density where you have probability of 1 for the predicted class and 0 for the other classes for each separate instance. Now having this densities one can build a confusion matrix by adding the probabilities from each instance and predicted class to the corresponding cell of the aggregated confusion matrix. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One can argue that this would give similar results like the previous method. However I think that this might be the case, the second method is less affected by how the samples from the tests are drawn, and thus more stable and closer to the reality. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also the second method might be altered in order to obtain a third method, where one can assign as prediction the label with highest density from the prediction of a given instance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not implemented those things but I plan to study further because I believe might worth spending some time.

The main advantage of the database is the ability to work with data much larger than memory, to have random or indexed access, and to add/append/modify data quickly.  The main *dis*advantage is that it is much slower than HDF, for problems in which the entire dataset needs to be read in and processed.  Another disadvantage is that, with the exception of embedded-style databases like SQLite, a database is a system (requiring admnistration, setup, maintenance, etc) rather than a simple self-contained data store.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The text file format options are XML/JSON/CSV.  They are cross-platform/language/toolkit, and are a good archival format due to the ability to be self-describing (or obvious :).  If uncompressed, they are huge (10x-100x HDF), but if compressed, they can be fairly space-efficient (compressed XML is about the same as HDF).  The main disadvantage here is again speed: parsing text is much, much slower than HDF.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other binary formats (npy/npz numpy files, blz blaze files, protocol buffers, Avro, ...) have very similar properties to HDF, except they are less widely supported (may be limited to just one platform: numpy) and may have specific other limitations.  They typically do not offer a compelling advantage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;HDF is a good complement to databases, it may make sense to run a query to produce a roughly memory-sized dataset and then cache it in HDF if the same data would be used more than once.  If you have a dataset which is fixed, and usually processed as a whole, storing it as a collection of appropriately sized HDF files is not a bad option.  If you have a dataset which is updated often, staging some of it as HDF files periodically might still be helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To summarize, HDF is a good format for data which is read (or written) typically as a whole; it is the lingua franca or common/preferred interchange format for many applications due to wide support and compatibility, decent as an archival format, and very fast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. To give this some practical context, my most recent experience comparing HDF to alternatives, a certain small (much less than memory-sized) dataset took 2 seconds to read as HDF (and most of this is probably overhead from Pandas); ~1 minute to read from JSON; and 1 *hour* to write to database.  Certainly the database write could be sped up, but you'd better have a good DBA!  This is how it works out of the box." />

For each document a mixture of topics is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, and then each word in the document is an independent draw from that mixture (that is, selecting a topic and then using it to generate a word).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For HDP (applied to document modeling), one also uses a Dirichlet process to capture the uncertainty in the number of topics.  So a common base distribution is selected which represents the countably-infinite set of possible topics for the corpus, and then the finite distribution of topics for each document is sampled from this base distribution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as pros and cons, HDP has the advantage that the maximum number of topics can be unbounded and learned from the data rather than specified in advance.

Text="**MapReduce**: A fault tolerant distributed computational framework. MapReduce allows you to operate over huge amounts of data- with a lot of work put in to prevent failure due to hardware. MapReduce is a poor choice for computing results on the fly because it is slow. (A typical MapReduce job takes on the order of minutes or hours, not microseconds)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A MapReduce job takes a file (or some data store) as an input and writes a file of results. If you want these results available to an application, it is your responsibility to put this data in a place that is accessible. This is likely slow, and there will be a lag between the values you can display, and the values that represent your system in its current state.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important distinction to make when considering using MapReduce in building realtime systems is that of training your model, and applying your model. If you think your model parameters do not change quickly, you can fit them with MapReduce, and then have a mechanism for accessing these pre-fit parameters when you want to apply your model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Storm**: A real-time, streaming computational system. Storm is online framework, meaning, in this sense, a service that interacts with a running application. In contrast to MapReduce, it receives small pieces of data (not a whole file) as they are processed in your application. You define a DAG of operations to perform on the data. A common and simple use case for Storm is tracking counters, and using that information to populate a real-time dashboard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Storm doesn't have anything (necessarily) to do with persisting your data. Here, streaming is another way to say keeping the information you care about and throwing the rest away.

Such diagnosis often requires manual analysis and inspection, and also out-of-band information such as information about the data sources and methods they used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, some data analysis methods work better when erroneous or missing data is left blank (or N/A) rather than imputed or given a default value.  This is true when there is explicit representations of uncertainty and ignorance, such as Dempster-Shafer Belief functions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, it's useful to have specific diagnostics and metrics for the cleaning process.

My main concern is always &quot;what do I do when I am dissatisfied with their service?&quot; - I can go to google and shift my analysis work into their paradigm or I can go to hadoop and shift that same work into that system.  Either way, I'm going to have to learn something new and do a lot of work translating things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That being said, it's nice to be able to upload a dataset and get to work quickly - especially if what I'm doing has a short lifecycle.  Amazon has done a good job of answering the data security problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to avoid hadoop, there will always be an alternative.  But it's not all that difficult to work with once you get going with it." />

When you repeat classification tests you will end up having multiple confusion matrices. The question is how to get a meaningful aggregate confusion matrix. The answer depends on what is the meaning of meaningful (pun intended). I think there is not a single version of meaningful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way is to follow the rough idea of multiple testing. In general, you test something multiple times in order to get more accurate results. As a general principle one can reason that averaging on the results of the multiple tests reduces the variance of the estimates, so as a consequence, it increases the precision of the estimates. You can proceed in this way, of course, by summing position by position and then dividing by the number of tests. You can go further and instead of estimating only a value for each cell of the confusion matrix, you can also compute some confidence intervals, t-values and so on. This is OK from my point of view. But it tell only one side of the story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other side of the story which might be investigated is how stable are the results for the same instances. To exemplify that I will take an extreme example. Suppose you have a classification model for 3 classes. Suppose that these classes are in the same proportion. If your model is able to predict one class perfectly and the other 2 classes with random like performance, you will end up having 0.33 + 0.166 + 0.166 = 0.66 misclassification ratio. This might seem good, but even if you take a look on a single confusion matrix you will not know that your performance on the last 2 classes varies wildly. Multiple tests can help. But averaging the confusion matrices would reveal this? My belief is not. The averaging will give the same result more or less, and doing multiple tests will only decrease the variance of the estimation. However it says nothing about the wild instability of prediction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So another way to do compose the confusion matrices would better involve a prediction density for each instance. One can build this density by counting for each instance, the number of times it was predicted a given class. After normalization, you will have for each instance a prediction density rather a single prediction label. You can see that a single prediction label is similar with a degenerated density where you have probability of 1 for the predicted class and 0 for the other classes for each separate instance. Now having this densities one can build a confusion matrix by adding the probabilities from each instance and predicted class to the corresponding cell of the aggregated confusion matrix. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One can argue that this would give similar results like the previous method. However I think that this might be the case sometimes, often when the model has low variance, the second method is less affected by how the samples from the tests are drawn, and thus more stable and closer to the reality. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also the second method might be altered in order to obtain a third method, where one can assign as prediction the label with highest density from the prediction of a given instance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not implemented those things but I plan to study further because I believe might worth spending some time.

All languages were designed to make some type of constructs more easy to build than others. And the knowledge and mastery of a programming language is more important and effective than the features of that language compared to others.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as I can see there are two dimensions of this question. The first dimension is the ability to explore, build proof of concepts or models at a fast pace, eventually having at hand enough tools to study what is going on (like statistical tests, graphics, measurement tools, etc). This kind of activity is usually preferred by researchers and data scientists (I always wonder what that means, but I use this term for its loose definition). They tend to rely on well-known and verified instruments, which can be used for proofs or arguments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second dimension is the ability to extend, change, improve or even create tools, algorithms or models. In order to achieve that you need a proper programming language. Roughly all of them are the same. If you work for a company, than you depend a lot on the company's infrastructure, internal culture and your choices diminish significantly. Also, when you want to implement an algorithm for production use, you have to trust the implementation. And implementing in another language which you do not master will not help you much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tend to favor for the first type of activity the R ecosystem. You have a great community, a huge set of tools, proofs that these tools works as expected. Also, you can consider Python, Octave (to name a few), which are reliable candidates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the second task, you have to think before at what you really want. If you want robust production ready tools, than C/C++, Java, C# are great candidates. I consider Python as a second citizen in this category, together with Scala and friends. I do not want to flame a war, it's my opinion only. But after more than 17 years as a developer, I tend to prefer a strict contract and my knowledge, than the freedom to do whatever you might think of (like it happens with a lot of dynamic languages).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I want to learn as much as possible.

To give you an example, suppose you have a binary classification model, with classes c1 and c2. For a given instance, your classifier would have to return a score for c1 and another for c2. If this score is a probability-like (preferrable), than something like p(c1), p(c2) would work. In plain English is translated like &quot;I (the model) classify this instance as c1 with probability p(c1), and as c2 with probability  p(c2)=1-p(c1)&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This applies for all type of classifiers, not only for decision trees. Having these scores you can than compute ROC or AUC by varying a threshold on p(c1) values, from the smallest to the greatest value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, if you have an implementation of a decision tree and you want to change that implementation to return scores instead of labels you have to compute those values. The most used way for decision trees is to use the proportion of classes from the leaf nodes. So, for example you have built a decision tree and when you predict the class for an instance you arrive at a leaf node which have (stored from the learning phase) 10 instances of class c1 and 15 instances of class c2, you can use the ratios as the scores. So, in our example, you would return p(c1) = 10 / (10+15) = 0.4 probability of class c1 and p(c2) = 15/(10+15)=0.6 probability of being class c2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For further reading on the ROC curves, the best and inspiring source of information I found to be the Tom Fawcett paper called [An Introduction to ROC Analysis][1], it's solid gold on this topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/ROCintro.pdf&amp;ei=DYCZU96QGPOV7AaAx4CgBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNECLoecin6ieT-0ymLQ--FoMjkMZw&amp;sig2=3bGE2y1N3I2Re_YWn0EDFA" />

All languages were designed to make some type of constructs more easy to build than others. And the knowledge and mastery of a programming language is more important and effective than the features of that language compared to others.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as I can see there are two dimensions of this question. The first dimension is the ability to explore, build proof of concepts or models at a fast pace, eventually having at hand enough tools to study what is going on (like statistical tests, graphics, measurement tools, etc). This kind of activity is usually preferred by researchers and data scientists (I always wonder what that means, but I use this term for its loose definition). They tend to rely on well-known and verified instruments, which can be used for proofs or arguments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second dimension is the ability to extend, change, improve or even create tools, algorithms or models. In order to achieve that you need a proper programming language. Roughly all of them are the same. If you work for a company, than you depend a lot on the company's infrastructure, internal culture and your choices diminish significantly. Also, when you want to implement an algorithm for production use, you have to trust the implementation. And implementing in another language which you do not master will not help you much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tend to favor for the first type of activity the R ecosystem. You have a great community, a huge set of tools, proofs that these tools works as expected. Also, you can consider Python, Octave (to name a few), which are reliable candidates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the second task, you have to think before at what you really want. If you want robust production ready tools, then C/C++, Java, C# are great candidates. I consider Python as a second citizen in this category, together with Scala and friends. I do not want to start a flame war, it's my opinion only. But after more than 17 years as a developer, I tend to prefer a strict contract and my knowledge, than the freedom to do whatever you might think of (like it happens with a lot of dynamic languages).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I want to learn as much as possible. I decided that I have to choose the hard way, which means to implement myself everything from scratch. I use R as a model and inspiration.

But if I need more performance or structured code I definitely use Python since it has some of the best libraries as SciKit-Learn, numpy, scipy etc. I use both R and Python in my projects interchangeably. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you are starting on data science work I suggest you to learn both and it's not difficult since Python also provides a similar interface to R with [Pandas][1]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have to deal with much larger datasets, you can't escape eco-systems built with Java(Hadoop, Pig, Hbase etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://pandas.pydata.org/" />

Model Building and Prediction phase. Typically, model building is performed as a batch process and **predictions are done realtime**. The model building process is a compute intensive process while the prediction happens in a jiffy. Therefore, performance of an algorithm in Python or R doesn't really affect the turn-around time of the user. Python 1, R 1.&#xD;&#xA; - **Production:** The real difference between Python and R comes in being production ready. Python, as such is a full fledged programming language and many organisations use it in their production systems. R is a statistical programming software favoured by many academia and due to the rise in data science and availability of libraries and being open source, the industry has started using R. Many of these organisations have their production systems either in Java, C++, C#, Python etc. So, ideally they would like to have the **prediction system** in the same language to reduce the latency and maintenance issues.&#xD;&#xA;Python 2, R 1.&#xD;&#xA; - **Libraries:** Both the languages have enormous and reliable libraries. R has over 5000 libraries catering to many domains while Python has some incredible packages like **Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib**. Python 3, R 2.&#xD;&#xA; - **Development:** Both the language are interpreted languages. Many say that python has a good learning curve, it's almost like reading english (to put it on a lighter note) but R has a reputation of having a steeper learning curve. Also, both of them have good IDEs (Spyder etc for Python and RStudio for R). Python 4, R 2.&#xD;&#xA; - **Speed:** R software initially had problems with large computations (say, like nxn matrix multiplications). But, this issue is addressed with the introduction of R by Revolution Analytics. They have re-written computation intensive operations in C which is blazingly fast. Python being a high level language is relatively slow. Python 4, R 3.&#xD;&#xA; - **Visualizations:** In data science, we frequently tend to plot data to showcase patterns to users. Therefore, visualisations become an important criteria in choosing a software and R completely kills Python in this regard. Thanks to Hadley Wickham for an incredible ggplot2 package. R wins hands down. Python 4, R 4.&#xD;&#xA; - **Dealing with Big Data:** One of the constraints of R is it stores the data in system memory (RAM). So, RAM capacity becomes a constraint when you are handling Big Data. Python does well, but I would say, as both R and Python have HDFS connectors, leveraging Hadoop infrastructure would give substantial performance improvement. So, Python 5, R 5.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, both the languages are equally good. Therefore, depending upon your domain and the place you work, you have got to smartly choose the right language. Technology world usually prefers single language. Business users (marketing analytics, retail analytics) usually go with statistical programming language R since they frequently do quick prototyping and build visualisations which is faster do in R." />

To determining the downsides of over and under fitting I find it helpful to think of it as an optimization problem, because in each cross section of predicted verses actual model performance there is either a cost or profit to be made:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this example predicting a default that is a default means avoiding any risk, and predicted a non-default which doesn't default will make $50 per loan issued.  Where things get dicey is when you are wrong, if you default when you predicted non-default you lose the entire loan principal and if you predict default when a customer actually would not have you suffer $50 of missed opportunity.  The numbers here are not important, just the approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this framework we can now begin to understand the difficulties associated with over and under fitting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over fitting in this case would mean that your model works far better on you development/test data then it does in production.  Or to put it another way, your model in production will far underperform what you saw in development, this false confidence will probably cause you to take on far more risky loans then you otherwise would and leaves you very vulnerable to losing money.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, under fitting in this context will leave you with a model that just does a poor job of matching reality.  While the results of this can be wildly unpredictable, (the opposite word you want to describe your predictive models), commonly what happens is standards are tightened up to compensate for this, leading to less overall customers leading to lost good customers.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Under fitting suffers a kind of opposite difficulty that over fitting does, which is under fitting gives you lower confidence.  Insidiously, the lack of predictability still leads you to take on unexpected risk, all of which is bad news.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience the best way to avoid both of these situations is validating your model on data that is completely outside the scope of your training data, so you can have some confidence that you have a representative sample of what you will see &quot;in the wild&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, it is always a good practice to revalidate your models periodically, to determine how quickly your model is degrading, and if it is still accomplishing your objectives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just to some things up, your model is under fitted when it does a poor job of predicting both the development and production data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/RgWr9.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/78kH2.png" />

The end results once trained is basically just an equation that based of the context of the words in the sentence can assign a probability of being spam.

If you need to handle larger-than-memory data sets, the platform need to handle it conveniently. In this case, SQL would cover for basic statistics, Python + Apache Spark is another option.&#xD;&#xA;  1. Does the platform covers all of my analysis needs? The greatest annoyance I've encountered in data mining projects is having to juggle between several tools, because tool A handles web connections well, tool B does the statistics and tool C renders nice pictures.

Break down your code in smaller functions, which can be tested and evaluated in smaller stes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Look for connected elements, e.g. the number of cases with condition X is Y - so this query MUST return Y. Most often this is more complex, but doable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. When you are running your script the first time, test it with a small subsample and carefully check if everything is in order. While I like unit tests in IT, bugs in statistics scripts are often so pronounced that they are easily visible doing a carefully check. Or they are methodical errors, which are probably never caught by unit tests.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That should suffice to ensure a clean &quot;one - off &quot; job. But for a time series as you seem to have, I would add that you should check for values out of range, impossible combinations etc. For me, most scripts that have reached step 4 are probably bug free - and they will stay that way unless something changes. And most often, the data are changing - and that is something which should be checked for every run.

There are a large number of reasons for this, but I'm going to build on some of the points that other people have mentioned here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Picking a single language:** It's definitely possible to mix and match languages, picking `d3` for your visualization needs, `FORTRAN` for your fast matrix multiplies, and `python` for all of your networking and scripting. You can do this down the line, but keeping your stack as simple as possible is a good move, especially early on.&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Picking something bigger than you:** You never want to be pushing up against the barriers of the language you want to use. This is a huge issue when it comes to languages like `Julia` and `FORTRAN`, which simply don't offer the full functionality of languages like `python` or `R`.&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Pick Community**: The one most difficult thing to find in any language is community. `Python` is the clear winner here. If you get stuck, you ask something on SO, and someone will answer in a matter of minutes, which is simply not the case for most other languages. If you're learning something in a vacuum you will simply learn much slower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of the minus points, I might actually push back on them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Deepening your knowledge of one language is a decent idea, but knowing *only* one language, without having practice generalizing that knowledge to other languages is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot. I have changed my entire favored development stack three time over as many years, moving from `MATLAB` to `Java` to `haskell` to `python`. Learning to transfer your knowledge to another language is far more valuable than just knowing one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as feasibility, this is something you're going to see again and again in any programming career. Turing completeness means you could technically do everything with `HTML4` and `CSS3`, but you want to pick the right tool for the job. If you see the ideal tool and decide to leave it by the roadside you're going to find yourself slowed down wishing you had some of the tools you left behind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A great example of that last point is trying to deploy `R` code. 'R''s networking capabilities are hugely lacking compared to `python`, and if you want to deploy a service, or use slightly off-the-beaten path packages, the fact that `pip` has an order of magnitude more packages than `CRAN` is a huge help." />

Generally, I have a relatively short list of qualifications I look for when it comes to any tool in this space. In no particular order they are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Performance**: Basically boils down to how quickly the language does matrix multiplication, as that is more or less the most important task in data science.&#xD;&#xA; - **Scalability**: At least for me personally, this comes down to ease of building a distributed system. This is somewhere where languages like `Julia` really shine.&#xD;&#xA; - **Community**: With any language, you're really looking for an active community that can help you when you get stuck using whichever tool you're using. This is where `python` pulls very far ahead of most other languages. &#xD;&#xA; - **Flexibility**: Nothing is worse than being limited by the language that you use. It doesn't happen very often, but trying to represent graph structures in `haskell` is a notorious pain, and `Julia` is filled with a lot of code architectures pains as a result of being such a young language.&#xD;&#xA; - **Ease of Use**: If you want to use something in a larger environment, you want to make sure that setup is a straightforward and it can be automated. Nothing is worse than having to set up a finnicky build on half a dozen machines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a ton of articles out there about performance and scalability, but in general you're going to be looking at a performance differential of maybe 5-10x between languages, which may or may not matter depending on your specific application. As far as GPU acceleration goes, `cudamat` is a really seamless way of getting it working with `python`, and the `cuda` library in general has made GPU acceleration far more accessible than it used to be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two primary metrics I use for both community and flexibility are to look at the language's package manager, and the language questions on a site like SO. If there are a large number of high-quality questions and answers, it's a good sign that the community is active. Number of packages and the general activity on those packages can also be a good proxy for this metric.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as ease of use goes, I am a firm believer that the only way to actually know is to actually set it up yourself. There's a lot of superstition around a lot of Data Science tools, specifically things like databases and distributed computing architecture, but there's no way to really know if something is easy or hard to setup up and deploy without just building it yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

They're easy to set up and scale - it's just a key/value store, and you can probably just re-use some of your caching logic for the most basic implementation.&#xD;&#xA;2. Depending on the size and type of the spam attack, there will probably be some very specific terms or URLs being used. It's much faster to throw that term into a blacklist than wait for your model to adapt.&#xD;&#xA;3. You can remove items just as quickly as you added them.&#xD;&#xA;4. Everybody understands how they work and any admin can use them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key to fighting spam is *monitoring*. Make sure you have some sort of interface showing which items are on your blacklist, how often they've been hit in the last 10 minutes / hour / day / month, and the ability to easily add and remove items.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You'll want to combine a number of different spam detection models and tactics.

So, I just can't do that without creating a new attribute for each distinct row of that nominal attribute, and furthermore most of the new columns would have NULL values if I do that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there any non-ILP algorithm that allows me to data mine relational databases without resorting to techniques like pivoting, which would create thousands of new columns?" />

Our usual approach here is to withhold data entirely, or in some cases to reduce its resolution; e.g., replacing an exact street address with the corresponding county or census tract. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means that certain types of analysis and processing must be done in-house, even when a third party has resources and expertise more suited to the task. Since the source data is not disclosed, the way we go about this analysis and processing lacks transparency. As a result, any third party's ability to perform QA/QC, adjust parameters or make refinements may be very limited.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anonymizing Confidential Data&#xD;&#xA;=&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One task involves identifying individuals by their names, in user-submitted data, while taking into account errors and inconsistencies. A private individual might be recorded in one place as &quot;Dave&quot; and in another as &quot;David,&quot; commercial entities can have many different abbreviations, and there are always some typos. I've developed scripts based on a number of criteria that determine when two records with non-identical names represent the same individual, and assign them a common ID. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point we can make the dataset anonymous by withholding the names and replacing them with this personal ID number. But this means the recipient has almost no information about e.g. the strength of the match. We would prefer to be able to pass along as much information as possible without divulging identity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What Doesn't Work&#xD;&#xA;=&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, it would be great to be able to encrypt strings while preserving edit distance. This way, third parties could do some of their own QA/QC, or choose to do further processing on their own, without ever accessing (or being able to potentially reverse-engineer) PII. Perhaps we match strings in-house with edit distance &lt;= 2, and the recipient wants to look at the implications of tightening that tolerance to edit distance &lt;= 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the only method I am familiar with that does this is ROT13, which hardly even counts as encryption; it's like writing the names upside down and saying, &quot;promise you won't flip the paper over?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another **bad** solution would be to abbreviate everything. &quot;Ellen Roberts&quot; becomes &quot;ER&quot; and so forth. This is a poor solution because in some cases the initials, in association with public data, will reveal a person's identity, and in other cases it's too ambiguous; &quot;Benjamin Othello Ames&quot; and &quot;Bank of America&quot; will have the same initials, but their names are otherwise dissimilar. So it doesn't do either of the things we want.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An inelegant alternative is to introduce additional fields to track certain attributes of the name, e.g.:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    +-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xD;&#xA;    | Row | ID | Name              | WordChars | Origin |&#xD;&#xA;    +-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xD;&#xA;    | 1   | 17 | &quot;AMELIA BEDELIA&quot;  | (6, 7)    | Eng    |&#xD;&#xA;    +-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xD;&#xA;    | 2   | 18 | &quot;CHRISTOPH BAUER&quot; | (9, 5)    | Ger    |&#xD;&#xA;    +-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xD;&#xA;    | 3   | 18 | &quot;C J BAUER&quot;       | (1, 1, 5) | Ger    |&#xD;&#xA;    +-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xD;&#xA;    | 4   | 19 | &quot;FRANZ HELLER&quot;    | (5, 6)    | Ger    |&#xD;&#xA;    +-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I call this &quot;inelegant&quot; because it requires anticipating which qualities might be interesting and it's relatively coarse. If the names are removed, there's not much you can reasonably conclude about the strength of the match between rows 2 &amp; 3, or about the distance between rows 2 &amp; 4 (i.e., how close they are to matching).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;=&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is to transform strings in such a way that as many useful qualities of the original string are preserved as possible while obscuring the original string. Decryption should be impossible, or so impractical as to be effectively impossible, no matter the size of the data set. In particular, a method that preserves the edit distance between arbitrary strings would be very useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've found a couple papers that might be relevant, but they're a bit over my head:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Privacy Preserving String Comparisons Based on Levenshtein Distance](http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2010-109.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;- [An Empirical Comparison of Approaches to Approximate String &#xD;&#xA;Matching in Private Record Linkage](https://www.uni-due.de/~hq0215/documents/2010/Bachteler_2010_An_Empirical_Comparison_Of_Approaches_To_Approximate_String_Matching_In_Private_Record_Linkage.pdf)" />

The protocol is based on Bloom filters on q-grams of identifiers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article goes into detail about the method, which I will summarize here to the best of my ability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Bloom filter is a fixed-length series of bits storing the results of a fixed set of independent hash functions, each computed on the same input value. The output of each hash function should be an index value from among the possible indexes in the filter; i.e., if you have a 0-indexed series of 10 bits, hash functions should return values from 0 to 9. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The filter starts with each bit set to 0. After hashing the input value with each function from the set of hash functions, each bit corresponding to an index value returned by any hash function is set to 1. If the same index is returned by more than one hash function, the bit at that index is only set once. You could consider the Bloom filter to be a superposition of the set of hashes onto the fixed range of bits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The protocol described in the above-linked article divides strings into n-grams, which are in this case sets of characters. As an example, `&quot;hello&quot;` might yield the following set of 2-grams:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [&quot;_h&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;el&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;o_&quot;]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Padding the front and back with spaces seems to be generally optional when constructing n-grams; the examples given in the paper that proposes this method use such padding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each n-gram can be hashed to produce a Bloom filter, and this set of Bloom filters can be superimposed on itself (bitwise OR operation) to produce the Bloom filter for the string.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the filter contains many more bits than there are hash functions or n-grams, arbitrary strings are relatively unlikely to produce exactly the same filter. However, the more n-grams two strings have in common, the more bits their filters will ultimately share. You can then compare any two filters `A, B` by means of their Dice coefficient:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;A, B&lt;/sub&gt; = 2h / (a + b)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where `h` is the number of bits that are set to 1 in both filters, `a` is the number of bits set to 1 in *only* filter A, and `b` is the number of bits set to 1 in *only* filter B. If the strings are exactly the same, the Dice coefficient will be 1; the more they differ, the closer the coefficient will be to `0`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because the hash functions are mapping an indeterminate number of unique inputs to a small number of possible bit indexes, different inputs may produce the same filter, so the coefficient indicates only a *probability* that the strings are the same or similar. The number of different hash functions and the number of bits in the filter are important parameters for determining the likelihood of false positives - pairs of inputs that are much less similar than the Dice coefficient produced by this method predicts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found [this tutorial](http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/) to be very helpful for understanding the Bloom filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is some flexibility in the implementation of this method; see also [this 2010 paper](https://www.uni-due.de/~hq0215/documents/2010/Bachteler_2010_An_Empirical_Comparison_Of_Approaches_To_Approximate_String_Matching_In_Private_Record_Linkage.pdf) (also linked at the end of the question) for some indications of how performant it is in relation to other methods, and with various parameters." />

Do you mean Spark vs *MapReduce*? Because Spark runs on/with Hadoop, which is rather the point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The primary reason to use Spark is for speed, and this comes from the fact that its execution can keep data in memory between stages rather than always persist back to HDFS after a Map or Reduce. This advantage is very pronounced for iterative computations, which have tens of stages each of which is touching the same data. This is where things might be &quot;100x&quot; faster. For simple, one-pass ETL-like jobs for which MapReduce was designed, it's not in general faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another reason to use Spark is its nicer high-level language compared to MapReduce. It provides a functional programming-like view that mimics Scala, which is far nicer than writing MapReduce code. (Although you have to either use Scala, or adopt the slightly-less-developed Java or Python APIs for Spark). [Crunch][1] and [Cascading][2] already provide a similar abstraction on top of MapReduce, but this is still an area where Spark is nice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally Spark has as-yet-young but promising subprojects for ML, graph analysis, and streaming, which expose a similar, coherent API.

The protocol is based on Bloom filters on q-grams of identifiers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article goes into detail about the method, which I will summarize here to the best of my ability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Bloom filter is a fixed-length series of bits storing the results of a fixed set of independent hash functions, each computed on the same input value. The output of each hash function should be an index value from among the possible indexes in the filter; i.e., if you have a 0-indexed series of 10 bits, hash functions should return (or be mapped to) values from 0 to 9. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The filter starts with each bit set to 0. After hashing the input value with each function from the set of hash functions, each bit corresponding to an index value returned by any hash function is set to 1. If the same index is returned by more than one hash function, the bit at that index is only set once. You could consider the Bloom filter to be a superposition of the set of hashes onto the fixed range of bits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The protocol described in the above-linked article divides strings into n-grams, which are in this case sets of characters. As an example, `&quot;hello&quot;` might yield the following set of 2-grams:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [&quot;_h&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;el&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;o_&quot;]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Padding the front and back with spaces seems to be generally optional when constructing n-grams; the examples given in the paper that proposes this method use such padding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each n-gram can be hashed to produce a Bloom filter, and this set of Bloom filters can be superimposed on itself (bitwise OR operation) to produce the Bloom filter for the string.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the filter contains many more bits than there are hash functions or n-grams, arbitrary strings are relatively unlikely to produce exactly the same filter. However, the more n-grams two strings have in common, the more bits their filters will ultimately share. You can then compare any two filters `A, B` by means of their Dice coefficient:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;A, B&lt;/sub&gt; = 2h / (a + b)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where `h` is the number of bits that are set to 1 in both filters, `a` is the number of bits set to 1 in *only* filter A, and `b` is the number of bits set to 1 in *only* filter B. If the strings are exactly the same, the Dice coefficient will be 1; the more they differ, the closer the coefficient will be to `0`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because the hash functions are mapping an indeterminate number of unique inputs to a small number of possible bit indexes, different inputs may produce the same filter, so the coefficient indicates only a *probability* that the strings are the same or similar. The number of different hash functions and the number of bits in the filter are important parameters for determining the likelihood of false positives - pairs of inputs that are much less similar than the Dice coefficient produced by this method predicts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found [this tutorial](http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/) to be very helpful for understanding the Bloom filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is some flexibility in the implementation of this method; see also [this 2010 paper](https://www.uni-due.de/~hq0215/documents/2010/Bachteler_2010_An_Empirical_Comparison_Of_Approaches_To_Approximate_String_Matching_In_Private_Record_Linkage.pdf) (also linked at the end of the question) for some indications of how performant it is in relation to other methods, and with various parameters." />

Depending on the nature of your system and task(s), you could consider adding a node dedicated to serving information between the processing nodes, and building a single cache on that node.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an example of when that *might* be a good idea, let's suppose I retrieve some data from a remote data store over a low-bandwidth connection, and I have some task(s) requiring that data, which are distributed exclusively among local nodes. I definitely wouldn't want each node requesting information separately over that low-bandwidth connection, which another node might have previously requested. Since my local I/O is much less expensive than my I/O over the low-bandwidth connection, I might add a node between the processing nodes and the remote source that acts as an intermediate server. This node would take requests from the processing nodes, communicate with the remote data store, and cache frequently-requested data to minimize the use of that low-bandwidth connection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The core concepts here that *may* be applicable to your specific case are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Eliminate or reduce redundant I/O;&#xD;&#xA;- Take advantage of trade-offs between memory use and computation time;&#xD;&#xA;- Not all I/O is created equal." />

A standard and intuitive approach is to represent each attribute as an individual dimension in a vector space. Each product is then simply a point in this space. In that case, if you want to dynamically add more attributes you simply have to remap the product vectors into the new feature space (with additional dimensions).    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this representation, a seller is a point in the feature space with product attributes and a buyer is a point in the same feature space with the preference attributes. The task is then to find out the most similar buyer point for a given seller point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your dataset (i.e. the number of buyers/sellers) is not very large, you can solve this with a nearest neighbour approach implemented with the help of k-d trees.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For very large sized data, you can take an IR approach. Index the set of sellers (i.e. the product attributes) by treating each attribute as a separate term with the term-weight being set to the attribute value.

One very common rule is to classify a success whenever P(A) &gt; 0.5.

First of all, correct, if I’m wrong:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* for exact product just a few features exist;&#xD;&#xA;* there is no ultimate features list, and clients are able to add new features to their products;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If so, constructing full product-feature table could be computational expensive. And final data table would be extremely sparse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the first step is narrowing customers (products) list for matching. Let’s build bipartite graph, where sellers would be type-1 nodes, and buyers would be type-2 nodes. Reference to similar product feature creates edge between seller and buyer. Here is a sketch:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![graph][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using graph, described above, for every exact seller’s product you can select only buyers, who is interested in matching features (it’s possible to filter «at least one» common feature, full matching, or threshold level). But certainly, that’s not enough. Next step is to compare feature values, described by seller and buyer. There are a lot of variants (e.g., kNN, or something else). But why not to try to solve this quest, using already existing graph? Let’s add weights to edges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* for continuous features (e.g., price): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  ![price_weight][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* for binary and non-quantifiable features - just logical biconditional:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  ![feature_weight][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main idea here is to «scale» every feature to `[0; 1]` interval. Additionally, we can use feature coefficients to determine most important features. E.g., assuming price is twice more important than availability of some rare function: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![adj_w_1][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![adj_w_2][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Almost final step: simplifying graph structure and reducing variety of edges to one edge with weight equal to sum of previously calculated weights of different features. With reduced structure every pair of customers/products could have only one edge (no parallel edges). So, to find the best deal for exact seller you just need to select connected buyers with max weighted edges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;!

So if you have a top 100 list for 5 months you will create one big table with 500 entries:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    User-id | Threat_score | month&#xD;&#xA;    aaa       45             1&#xD;&#xA;    bbb       32             1&#xD;&#xA;    ccc       20             1&#xD;&#xA;    ...       ...            ...&#xD;&#xA;    bbb       64             2&#xD;&#xA;    ccc       29             2&#xD;&#xA;    ...       ...            ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, to answer your first question, you could simply count the occurrences of each user-id. For example, if user `bbb` is in your concatenated table five times, then you know that person made your list all five months.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer you second question, you could do a `group by` operation to compute some aggregate function of the users. A `group by` operation with an average function is a little crude and sensitive to outliers, but it would probably get you close to what you are looking for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One possibility for the third question is to compute the difference in threat score between month `n-1` and month `n`. That is, for each month (not including the first month) you subtract the user's previous threat score from the current threat score. You can make this a new column so your table would now look like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    User-id | Threat_score | month | difference&#xD;&#xA;    aaa       45             1       null&#xD;&#xA;    bbb       32             1       null&#xD;&#xA;    ccc       20             1       null&#xD;&#xA;    ...       ...            ...     ...&#xD;&#xA;    bbb       64             2       32&#xD;&#xA;    ccc       29             2       9&#xD;&#xA;    ...       ...            ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this table, you could again do a `group by` operation to find people who consistently have a higher threat score than the previous month or you could simply find people with a large difference between the current month and the previous month.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you suggest, visualizing this data is a really good idea. If you care about these threat scores over time (which I think you do), I strongly recommend a simple line chart, with month on the x-axis and threat score on the y-axis. It's not fancy, but it's extremely easy to interpret and should give you useful information about the trends.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of this stuff (not the visualization) can be done in SQL and all of it can be done in R or Python (and many other languages).

Each client has websites ranging in size from 5 pages to well over 1 million. Over the course of the past 5 year, each agency has annotated all of their work for each client, including the type of work that was done, the number of webpages on a website that were influenced, the number of hours spent, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the above data, which I have assembled into a data warehouse (placed into a bunch of star/snowflake schemas), I need to determine how likely it was that any one piece of work (any one event in time) had an impact on the traffic hitting any/all pages influenced by a specific piece of work. I have created models for 40 different types of content that are found on a website that describes the typical traffic pattern a page with said content type might experience from launch date until present. Normalized relative to the appropriate model, I need to determine the highest and lowest number of increased or decreased visitors a specific page received as the result of a specific piece of work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I have experience with basic data analysis (linear and multiple regression, correlation, etc), I am at a loss for how to approach solving this problem. Whereas in the past I have typically analyzed data with multiple measurements for a given axis (for example temperature vs thirst vs animal and determined the impact on thirst that increased temperate has across animals), I feel that above, I am attempting to analyze the impact of a single event at some point in time for a non-linear, but predictable (or at least model-able), longitudinal dataset.

Create an edge between any seller and buyer every time they reference a similar product feature, as in the following sketch:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![graph][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the above graph, for every unique seller’s product you can select only buyers who are interested in features that match the product (it’s possible to filter **at least one** common feature, match the full set of features, or set a threshold level). But certainly, that’s not enough. The next step is to compare feature values, as described by the seller and buyer. There are a lot of variants (e.g., k-Nearest-Neighbors). But why not try to solve this question using the existing graph? Let’s add weights to the edges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* for continuous features (e.g., price): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  ![price_weight][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* for binary and non-quantifiable features - just logical biconditional:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  ![feature_weight][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main idea here is to **scale** every feature to the interval `[0, 1]`. Additionally, we can use feature coefficients to determine most important features. E.g., assuming price is twice as important as availability of some rare function: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![adj_w_1][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![adj_w_2][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the final steps is simplifying the graph structure and reducing many edges to one edge with weight equal to the sum of the previously calculated weights of each feature. With such a reduced structure every pair of customers/products could have only one edge (no parallel edges). So, to find the best deal for exact seller you just need to select connected buyers with max weighted edges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Future challenge: introduce a cheap method for weighting edges on first step :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/q1JTN.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Cprice_%7Bsell%7D%20-%20price_%7Bbuy%7D%7C%7D%7B%5Cmax%28price%29%20-%20%5Cmin%28price%29%7D&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20feature_%7Bsell%7D%20%5Cleftrightarrow%20feature_%7Bbuy%7D&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=adj.price.weight%20%3D%202%20%5Ctimes%20price.weight&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=adj.feature.weight%20%3D%201%20%5Ctimes%20feature.weight" />

First remark: don't limit yourself to one language. Learning a new language is always a good thing, but at some point you will need to choose.

Note that this these libraries need not be in whatever language you are considering, as long as you can interface easily. Working in a language without library access won't help you get things done.&#xD;&#xA; - **number of experts**: if you want external developers or start working in a team, you have to consider how many people actually know the language.

We can denote the parameters of the Dirichlet as a vector of size K of the form ~ 1/B(a) * Product(x_i ^ (a_i-1)), where a is the vector of size K of the parameters, and sum of x_i = 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now the LDA uses some constructs like:&#xD;&#xA;- a document can have multiple topics (because of this multiplicity, we need the Dirichlet distribution); and there is a Dirichlet distribution which models this relation&#xD;&#xA;- words can also belong to multiple topics, when you consider them outside of a document; so here we need another Dirichlet to model this&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The previous two are distributions which you do not really see from data, this is why is called latent, or hidden.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, in Bayesian inference you use the Bayes rule to infer the posterior probability. For simplicity, let's say you have data *x* and you have a model for this data governed by some parameters theta. In order to infer values for this parameters, in full Bayesian inference you will infer the posterior probability of these parameters using Bayes' rule with *p(theta|x) = p(x|theta)p(theta|alpha)/p(x|alpha)*. In plain words is *posterior probability = likelihood x prior probability / marginal likelihood*. Note that here comes an *alpha*. This is your initial belief about this distribution, and is the parameter of the prior distribution. Usually this is chosen in such a way that will have a conjugate prior (so the distribution of the posterior is the same with the distribution of the prior) and often to encode some knowledge if you have one or to have maximum entropy if you know nothing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The parameters of the prior are called *hyperparameters*. So, in LDA, both topic distributions, over documents and over words have also correspondent priors, which are denoted usually with alpha and beta, and because are the parameters of the prior distributions are called hyperparameters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now about choosing priors. If you plot some Dirichlet distributions you will note that if the individual parameters *alpha_k* have the same value, the pdf is symmetric in the simplex defined by the *x* values, which is the minimum or maximum for pdf is at the center. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If all the alpha_k have values lower than unit the maximum is found at corners&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5khZE.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or can if all values alpha_k are the same and greater than 1 the maximum will be found in center like &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/prmlfigs-png/Figure2.5c.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is easy to see that if values for alpha_k are not equal the symmetry is broken and the maximum will be found near bigger values. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additional, please note that values for priors parameters produce smooth pdfs of the distribution as the values of the parameters are near 1. So if you have great confidence that something is clearly distributed in a way you know, with a high degree of confidence, than values far from 1 in absolute value are to be used, if you do not have such kind of knowledge than values near 1 would be encode this lack of knowledge. It is easy to see why 1 plays such a role in Dirichlet distribution from the formula of the distribution itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another way to understand this is to see that prior encode prior-knowledge. In the same time you might think that prior encode some prior seen data. This data was not saw by the algorithm itself, it was saw by you, you learned something, and you can model prior according to what you know (learned). So in the prior parameters (hyperparameters) you encode also how big this data set you apriori saw, because the sum of alpha_k can be that also as the size of this more or less imaginary data set. So the bigger the prior data set, the bigger is the confidence, the bigger the values of alpha_k you can choose, the sharper the surface near maximum value, which means also less doubts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope it helped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PS: It's a hell to write something without LaTeX notation.

So, from a statistical perspective, a model is assumed and given various assumptions the errors are treated and the model parameters and other questions are inferred. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Machine learning comes from a computer science perspective. The models are algorithmic and usually very few assumptions are required regarding the data. We work with hypothesis space and learning bias. The best exposition of machine learning I found is contained in Tom Mitchell's book called [Machine Learning][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a more exhaustive and complete idea regarding the two cultures you can read the Leo Broiman paper called [Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However what must be added is that even if the two sciences started with different perspectives, both of them now now share a fair amount of common knowledge and techniques. Why, because the problems were the same, but the tools were different. So now machine learning is mostly treated from a statistical perspective (check the Hastie,Tibshirani, Friedman book [The Elements of Statistical Learning][3] from a machine learning point of view with a statistical treatement, and perhaps Kevin P. Murphy 's book [Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective][4], to name just a few of the best books available today). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even the history of the development of this field show the benefits of this merge of perspectives. I will describe two events. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first is the creation of CART trees, which was created by Breiman with a solid statistical background. At approximately the same time, Quinlan developed ID3,C45,See5, and so on, decision tree suite with a more computer science background. Now both this families of trees and the ensemble methods like bagging and forests become quite similar. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second story is about boosting. Initially they were developed by Freund and Shapire when they discovered AdaBoost. The choices for designing AdaBoost were done mostly from a computational perspective. Even the authors did not understood well why it works. Only 5 years later Breiman (again!) described the adaboost model from a statistical perspective and gave an explanation for why that works. Since then, various eminent scientists, with both type of backgrounds, developed further those ideas leading to a Pleiads of boosting algorithms, like logistic boosting, gradient boosting, gentle boosting ans so on. It is hard now to think at boosting without a solid statistical background.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;GLM is a statistical development. However new Bayesian treatments puts this algorithm also in machine learning playground. So I believe both claims could be right, since the interpretation and treatment of how it works could be different. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http://strimmerlab.org/courses/ss09/current-topics/download/breiman2001.pdf&amp;ei=RQGkU_DgH8Le7AaRmID4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNnrlqadmBT2fZMT_NfoUQ1rEuow&amp;sig2=g5qovUTsuuJUGGE64g0nrQ&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-2" />

My approach hinges on you being able to summarize traffic on a given page before and after some intervention. What you care about is the difference in the *rate* before and after the intervention. That is, how does the number of hits per day change? Below, I explain a first stab approach with some simulated example data. I will then explain one potential pitfall (and what I would do about it).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, let's think about one page before and after an intervention. Pretend the intervention increases hits per day by roughly 15%:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    import numpy as np&#xD;&#xA;    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&#xD;&#xA;    import seaborn as sns&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    def simulate_data(true_diff=0):&#xD;&#xA;        #First choose a number of days between [1, 1000] before the intervention&#xD;&#xA;        num_before = np.random.randint(1, 1001)&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;        #Next choose a number of days between [1, 1000] after the intervention&#xD;&#xA;        num_after = np.random.randint(1, 1001)&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;        #Next choose a rate for before the intervention.

But in order to quantify the difference in rates, we should use one company's intervention for multiple pages. Since the underlying rate will be different for each page, we should compute the percent change in rate (again, the rate here is hits per day).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, let's pretend we have data for `n = 100` pages, each of which received an intervention from the same company. To get the percent difference we take (mean(hits per day before) - mean(hits per day after)) / mean(hits per day before):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    n = 100&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    pct_diff = np.zeros(n)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    for i in xrange(n):&#xD;&#xA;        vpd_before, vpd_after = simulate_data(.15)&#xD;&#xA;        # % difference. Note: this is the thing we want to infer&#xD;&#xA;        pct_diff[i] = (vpd_after.mean() - vpd_before.mean()) / vpd_before.mean()&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    plt.hist(pct_diff)&#xD;&#xA;    plt.title(&quot;Distribution of percent change&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;    plt.xlabel(&quot;Percent change&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;    plt.ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;    plt.show()&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distribution of percent change][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have the distribution of our parameter of interest! We can query this result in different ways. For example, we might want to know the mode, or (approximation of) the most likely value for this percent change:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def mode_continuous(x, num_bins=None):&#xD;&#xA;        if num_bins is None:&#xD;&#xA;            counts, bins = np.histogram(x)&#xD;&#xA;        else:&#xD;&#xA;            counts, bins = np.histogram(x, bins=num_bins)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        ndx = np.argmax(counts)&#xD;&#xA;        return bins[ndx:(ndx+1)].mean()&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    mode_continuous(pct_diff, 20)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I ran this I got 0.126, which is not bad, considering our true percent change is 15. We can also see the number of positive changes, which approximates the probability that a given company's intervention improves hits per day:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    (pct_diff &gt; 0).mean()&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, my result is 0.93, so we could say there's a pretty good chance that this company is effective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, a potential pitfall: Each page probably has some underlying trend that you should probably account for. That is, even without the intervention, hits per day may increase. To account for this, I would estimate a simple linear regression where the outcome variable is hits per day and the independent variable is day (start at day=0 and simply increment for all the days in your sample). Then subtract the estimate, y_hat, from each number of hits per day to de-trend your data. Then you can do the above procedure and be confident that a positive percent difference is not due to the underlying trend. Of course, the trend may not be linear, so use discretion!

The higher ups would approve them and then they would begin their &quot;test&quot;.  Results would come back, and management would dump it on the data analysts to determine what worked and who did it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The short answer is you cant really know if it wasn't run as a random A/B style test on like time periods.  But I am very aware of how deficient that answer is, especially if the fact that a pure answer doesn't exist is irrelevant to the urgency of future business decisions.  Here are some of the techniques I would use to salvage the analysis in this situation, bear in mind this is more of an art then a science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Handles**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A handle is something that exists in the data that you can hold onto.  From what you are telling me in your situation you have a lot of info on who the marketing agency is, when they tried a tactic, and to which site they applied it to.  These are your starting point and information like this going to be the corner stone of your analysis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Methodology**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The methodology is going to probably hold the strongest impact on which agencies are given credit for any and all gains so you are going to need to make sure that it is clearly outlines and all stake holders agree that it makes sense.  If you cant do that it is going to be difficult for people to trust your analysis.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example of this are conversions. Say the marketing department purchases some leads and they arrive at our landing page, we would track them for 3 days, if they made a purchase within that time we would count them as having been converted.  Why 3 days, why not 5 or 1?  Thats not important as long as everyone agrees, you now have a definition you can build off of.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Comparisons**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an ideal would you would have a nice A/B test to prove a definitive relationship, I am going to assume that you are running short on those, still, you can learn something from a simple comparison of like data.  When companies are trying to determine the efficacy of radio advertising they will often run ads on offset months in the same market, or for several months in one market and compare that with the results in a separate but similar market.  Its doesn't pass for science, but even with all that noise a strong results will almost always be noticeable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would combine these in your case to determine how long an event is given to register an effect.  Once you have the data from that time period run it against your modeled out traffic prediction, week over week growth, month over month etc. Which, can then allow a meaningful comparison between agencies, and across time periods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Pragmatism**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The aspiration is to be able to provide a deep understanding of cause and effect, but it is probably not realistic.  Because of how messy outside factors make your analysis, you are constantly going to run up against the question over and over again: Did this event raise volume/sales/click throughs, or would doing anything at all have had the same effect?  The best advise I can give for this is set very realistic goals for what you are looking to measure.  A good starting point is, within the methodology you have, which event had the largest impact.  Once you have those open your aperture from there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Summary**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have reasoned out all of these aspects you can go about building a general solution which can then be automated.  The advantage to designing your solution in this manner is that the business logic is already built in.  This will make your results much more approachable and intuitive to non-technical business leaders." />

The way I'd approach the problem is to apply a standard discriminative classification approach such as SVM.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a discriminative classification approach the notion of similarity or inverse distance between data points (documents in this case) is pivotal. Fortunately for documents, there is a standard way of defining pairwise similarity. This is the standard [cosine similarity][1] measure which makes use of document length normalization to take different document lengths into account.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, practically speaking, in cosine similarity you would work with relative term weights normalized by document lengths and hence document length diversity should not be a major issue in the similarity computation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One also has to be careful when applying idf in term weights. If the number of documents is not significantly large the idf measure may be statistically imprecise thus adding noise to the term weights. It's also a standard practice to ignore stopwords and punctuations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" />

I consider Data mining to be one of the miscellaneous fields in Data science. Data Mining is mostly considered on yielding questions rather than answering them.

For example, if each observation has 100 attributes, then 1,500 observations is low.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another potential downside to k-fold cross-validation is the possibility of a single, extreme outlier skewing the results.

Hyperparameters that can be modified are: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - number of features&#xD;&#xA; - order of the polynomial&#xD;&#xA; - regularization parameter &#xD;&#xA; - number of layers in the network&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Best settings can be selected by the performance on cross validation set.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617365/what-is-a-learning-curve-in-machine-learning" />

This is an important parameter for back-propagation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For estimating your model parameters, as user tomaskazemekas pointed out, plotting Learning Curves is a very good approach. In addition to that, you could also create a plot using a model parameter (e.g. training epochs or hidden layer size) vs. Training and Validation error. This will allow you to understand the bias/variance tradeoff, and help you pick a good value for your parameters. [Some info can be found here][1]. Naturally, it is a good idea to keep a small percentage of your data for a (third) Test set.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a side note, it seems that increasing the number of neurons in your model show no significant improvement for your RMSE. This suggests that you could also try with a simpler model, i.e. with less neurons and see how your model behaves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, I would suggest (if you haven't done so already) trying a simple model with few or no parameters first e.g. Linear Regression, and compare your results with the literature, just as a sanity check. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.astroml.org/sklearn_tutorial/practical.html#cross-validation-and-testing" />

You could hold constant the previous value. If there is some great previous literature to apply, and you really have a strong case that the &quot;bad&quot; data is purely due to equipment malfunction, perhaps there's an established model that you can apply to fill in those regions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a great many approaches, which is why the most important thing is to document your process, explicitly and exhaustively.

Do not modify the original data**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having the original data source intact is important.  You may find that updates you make to the data are not valid.

You do not want your projects to be dependent on a single individual accomplishing a judgement based task of varying scale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's much better to have that individual build and document a rule set based on what they would do than to have them manually cleanse data.

I did the following approach:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Rather than associating data to ages (15 y.o., 27 y.o., ...) what I did is to establish different groups of ages: Less than 18, from 18 to 30 and greater than 30 (this is due to the specific problem we were facing, but you can choose whatever intervals you want). This division helps a lot to solve the problem.&#xD;&#xA; - Afterwards, I created a hierarchical clustering (divisive or aggregative). Then I choose those branches where I had users with known ages (or group ages) and then for that branch I extended the same age to that group.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This approach is **semi-supervised learning** and I recommended it in case you only have some data labeled.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please, notice that on a social network, people usually lie about the age (just for fun, or sometimes because they want to camuflate themselves on the social net)." />

You can use a bunch of different technics to complete this task, but my vote is for simplest ones (KISS, yes). E.g., in my case, for age prediction, mean of ego-network users' ages gave satisfactory results (for about 70% of users error was less than +/-3 years, in my case it was enough). It's just an idea, but you can try to use for age prediction weighted average, defining weight as similarity measure between visited sites sets of current user and others.&#xD;&#xA;2. Evaluating prediction quality. Algorithm from task-1 will produce prediction almost in all cases. And second task is to determine, if prediction is reliable. E.g., in case of ego network and age prediction: can we trust in prediction, if a user has only one 'friend' in his ego network? This task is more about machine-learning: it's a binary classification problem. You need to compose features set, form training and test samples from your data with both right and wrong predictions. Creating appropriate classifier will help you to filter out unpredictable users. But you need to determine, what are your features set.

As adesantos already said, one of the possibilities is to fit a distribution. For example, you could fit a multivariate Gaussian to the data. You will get the mean only from the samples you know and you calculate the covariances only from the samples you know. You can then use standard MVG results to impute the missing data linearly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is probably the simplest probabilistic method of imputation and it is already quite involved. If you are a neural networks, a recently proposed method that can do so are deep latent gaussian models by Rezende et al. However, understand the method will require a lot of neural net knowledge, quite some variational Bayes knowledge about Markov chains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another method, which I have hear to work well is to train a generative stochastic network (Bengio et al). This is done by training a denoising auto encoder on the data you have (neglecting missing values in the reconstruction loss). Say you have a reconstruction function f and a input x. Then you will reconstruct it via x' = f(x). You then reset the values of x' with those you know from x. (I.e. you only keep the values that were missing before reconstruction.) If you do so many times, you are guaranteed to sample from the distribution given the values you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But in either case, these methods require quite some knowledge about statistics and neural nets." />

Group `A` intends to buy and group `B` intends to sell a determined product `X`. The product has a series of attributes `x_i`, and my objective is to facilitate the transaction between `A` and `B` by matching their preferences. The main idea is to point out to each member of `A` a corresponding in `B` whose product better suits his needs, and vice versa. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some complicating aspects of the problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The list of attributes is not finite. The buyer might be interested in a very particular characteristic or some kind of design, which is rare among the population and I can't predict. Can't previously list all the attributes;&#xD;&#xA;	 &#xD;&#xA;2. Attributes might be continuous, binary or non-quantifiable (ex: price, functionality, design);&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any suggestion on how to approach this problem and solve it in an automated way? The idea is to really think out of the box here, so feel free to &quot;go wild&quot; on your suggestions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would also appreciate some references to other similar problems if possible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Great suggestions! Many similarities in to the way I’m thinking of approaching the problem.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;The main issue on mapping the attributes is that the level of detail to which the product should be described depends on each buyers. Let’s take an example of a car. The product “car” has lots and lots of attributes that range from its performance, mechanical structure, price etc.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Suppose I just want a cheap car, or an electric car. Ok, that’s easy to map because they represent main features of this product. But let’s say, for instance, that I want a car with Dual-Clutch transmission or Xenon headlights. Well there might be many cars on the data base with this attributes but I wouldn’t ask the seller to fill in this level of detail to their product prior to the information that there is someone looking them.  Such a procedure would require every seller fill a complex, very detailed, form just try to sell his car on the platform. Just wouldn’t work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But still, my challenge is to try to be as detailed as necessary in the search to make a good match. So the way I’m thinking is mapping main aspects of the product, those that are probably relevant to everyone, to narrow down de group of potential sellers.&#xD;&#xA;Next step would be a “refined search”. In order to avoid creating a too detailed form I could ask buyers and sellers to write a free text of their specification. And then use some word matching algorithm to find possible matches. Although I understand that this is not a proper solution to the problem because the seller cannot “guess” what the buyer needs.  But might get me close.  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;The weighting criteria suggested is great.  It allows me to quantify the level to which the seller matches the buyer’s needs.  The scaling part might be a problem though, because the importance of each attribute varies from client to client. I’m thinking of using some kind of pattern recognition or just asking de buyer to input the level of importance of each attribute. &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;I’m not a native English speaker so hope I’m being able to express my ideas properly. &#xD;&#xA;" />

In most basic terms, it acts as a layer interfacing between the virtual OS, and your own OS which then communicates with the lower level hardware to provide support to the virtual OS. What this means for you is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Cons&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Hardware Support &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A drawback of virtual machine technology is that it supports only the hardware that both the virtual machine hypervisor and the guest operating system support. Even if the guest operating system supports the physical hardware, it sees only the virtual hardware presented by the virtual machine. &#xD;&#xA;The second aspect of virtual machine hardware support is the hardware presented to the guest operating system. No matter the hardware in the host, the hardware presented to the guest environment is usually the same (with the exception of the CPU, which shows through). For example, VMware GSX Server presents an AMD PCnet32 Fast Ethernet card or an optimized VMware-proprietary network card, depending on which you choose. The network card in the host machine does not matter. VMware GSX Server performs the translation between the guest environment's network card and the host environment's network card. This is great for standardization, but it also means that host hardware that VMware does not understand will not be present in the guest environment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Performance Penalty&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Virtual machine technology imposes a performance penalty from running an additional layer above the physical hardware but beneath the guest operating system. The performance penalty varies based on the virtualization software used and the guest software being run. This is significant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Pros&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Isolation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One of the key reasons to employ virtualization is to isolate applications from each other. Running everything on one machine would be great if it all worked, but many times it results in undesirable interactions or even outright conflicts. The cause often is software problems or business requirements, such as the need for isolated security. Virtual machines allow you to isolate each application (or group of applications) in its own sandbox environment. The virtual machines can run on the same physical machine (simplifying IT hardware management), yet appear as independent machines to the software you are running. For all intents and purposes—except performance, the virtual machines are independent machines. If one virtual machine goes down due to application or operating system error, the others continue running, providing services your business needs to function smoothly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Standardization&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Another key benefit virtual machines provide is standardization. The hardware that is presented to the guest operating system is uniform for the most part, usually with the CPU being the only component that is &quot;pass-through&quot; in the sense that the guest sees what is on the host. A standardized hardware platform reduces support costs and increases the share of IT resources that you can devote to accomplishing goals that give your business a competitive advantage. The host machines can be different (as indeed they often are when hardware is acquired at different times), but the virtual machines will appear to be the same across all of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Ease of Testing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Virtual machines let you test scenarios easily. Most virtual machine software today provides snapshot and rollback capabilities. This means you can stop a virtual machine, create a snapshot, perform more operations in the virtual machine, and then roll back again and again until you have finished your testing. This is very handy for software development, but it is also useful for system administration. Admins can snapshot a system and install some software or make some configuration changes that they suspect may destabilize the system. If the software installs or changes work, then the admin can commit the updates. If the updates damage or destroy the system, the admin can roll them back.&#xD;&#xA;Virtual machines also facilitate scenario testing by enabling virtual networks. In VMware Workstation, for example, you can set up multiple virtual machines on a virtual network with configurable parameters, such as packet loss from congestion and latency. You can thus test timing-sensitive or load-sensitive applications to see how they perform under the stress of a simulated heavy workload.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Mobility&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Virtual machines are easy to move between physical machines. Most of the virtual machine software on the market today stores a whole disk in the guest environment as a single file in the host environment. Snapshot and rollback capabilities are implemented by storing the change in state in a separate file in the host information. Having a single file represent an entire guest environment disk promotes the mobility of virtual machines. Transferring the virtual machine to another physical machine is as easy as moving the virtual disk file and some configuration files to the other physical machine. Deploying another copy of a virtual machine is the same as transferring a virtual machine, except that instead of moving the files, you copy them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Which VM should I use if I am starting out?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Data Science Box or the Data Science Toolbox are your best bets if you just getting into data science. They have the basic software that you will need, with the primary difference being the virtual environment in which each of these can run. The DSB can run on AWS while the DST can run on Virtual Box (which is the most common tool used for VMs).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Sources&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://www.devx.com/vmspecialreport/Article/30383&#xD;&#xA;- http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html&#xD;&#xA;" />

Remove items appearing too infrequently in the data. That will reduce the dimensionality by several orders of magnitude. If a feature occurs less than say 10 times, it's likely that it's not adding any predictive value, and it may lead to overfitting due to low frequency&#xD;&#xA;2. Try a Linear SVM instead. They handle large dimensional data very well in terms of not overfitting. They also often have the option to assign relative weights to different classes, which may help address your unbalanced problem above. The sklearn svm (which simply wraps some other packages such as libsvm) has this option.&#xD;&#xA;3. Don't use the ID column. Producing a model per user will most probably lead to overfitting. Instead, feed in attributes that describe the user that allows the model to generalize over similar users. You could try fitting a separate model per user, but you need a lot of data per user to do this well.&#xD;&#xA;4. It sounds like you really need to try some feature selection here, to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. But try 1 and 2 first, as they may give you good results sooner (although the end solution may still work better with some good feature selection). Sklearn again has a number of options for feature selection.&#xD;&#xA;" />

There are many ways to handle it. I guess, resumes can be treated as semi-structured documents. Sometimes, it's beneficial to have some minimal structure in the documents. I believe, in resumes you would see some tabular data. You might want to treat these as attribute value pairs. For example, you would get a list of terms for the attribute &quot;Skill set&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key idea is to manually configure a list of key phrases such as &quot;skill&quot;, &quot;education&quot;, &quot;publication&quot; etc. The next step is to extract terms which pertain to these key phrases either by exploiting the structure in some way (such as tables) or by utilizing the proximity of terms around these key phrases, e.g. the fact that the word &quot;Java&quot; is in close proximity to the term &quot;skill&quot; might indicate that the person is skilled in Java.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After you extract these information, the next step could be to build up a feature vector for each of these key phrases. You can then represent a document as a vector with different fields (one each for a key phrase). For example, consider the following two resumes represented with two fields, namely *project* and *education*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Doc1: {project: (java, 3) (c, 4)}, {education: (computer, 2), (physics, 1)}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Doc2: {project: (java, 3) (python, 2)}, {education: (maths, 3), (computer, 2)}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the above example, I show a term with the frequency. Of course, while extracting the terms you need to stem and remove stop-words. It is clear from the examples that the person whose resume is Doc1 is more skilled in C than that of D2. Implementation wise, it's very easy to represent documents as field vectors in Lucene.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, the next step is to retrieve a ranked list of resumes given a job specification. In fact, that's fairly straight forward if you represent queries (job specs) as field vectors as well. You just need to retrieve a ranked list of candidates (resumes) using Lucene from a collection of indexed resumes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is often a really good thing, because it allows neural nets to fit very complex patterns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in a stock exchange any complex pattern, when traded upon will quickly decay. Detecting a complicated pattern will generally not generate useful results, because it is typically complex patterns in the short term. Additionally, depending on the metric you choose, there are a number of ways of performing well that actually won't pay off in investing (such as just predicting the last value in your example).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition the stock market is startlingly chaotic which can result in a `neural net` overfitting. This means that the patterns it learns will generalize poorly. Something along the lines of just seeing a stock decrease over a day and uniformly deciding that the stock will always decrease just because it was seen on a relatively short term. Instead techniques like `ridge` and `robust regression`, which will identify more general, less complex patterns, do better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The winner of a similar Kaggle competition used `robust regression` for this very reason. You are likely to see better results if you switch to a shallow learning model that will find functions of a lower polynomial order, over the deep complex functions of a neural net." />

With that said, there's very little information in cosine distance that can actually be mapped back to anything semantic, which seems to be non-ideal for this situation.&#xD;&#xA; - [Levenshtein Distance][2] - Also known as `edit distance`, this is usually just used on the individual token level (words, bigrams, etc...). In general I wouldn't recommend this metric as it not only discards any semantic information, but also tends to treat very different word alterations very similarly, but it is an extremely common metric for this kind of thing&#xD;&#xA; - [LSA][3] - Is a part of a large arsenal of techniques when it comes to evaluating document similarity called `topic modeling`. LSA has gone out of fashion pretty recently, and in my experience, it's not quite the strongest topic modeling approach, but it is relatively straightforward to implement and has a few open source implementations&#xD;&#xA; - [LDA][4] - Is also a technique used for `topic modeling`, but it's different from `LSA` in that it actually learns internal representations that tend to be more smooth and intuitive. In general, the results you get from `LDA` are better for modeling document similarity than `LSA`, but not quite as good for learning how to discriminate strongly between topics.&#xD;&#xA; - [Pachinko Allocation][5] - Is a really neat extension on top of LDA. In general, this is just a significantly improved version of `LDA`, with the only downside being that it takes a bit longer to train and open-source implementations are a little harder to come by&#xD;&#xA; - [word2vec][6] - Google has been working on a series of techniques for intelligently reducing words and documents to more reasonable vectors than the sparse vectors yielded by techniques such as `Count Vectorizers` and `TF-IDF`. Word2vec is great because it has a number of open source implementations. Once you have the vector, any other similarity metric (like cosine distance) can be used on top of it with significantly more efficacy.&#xD;&#xA; - [doc2vec][7] - Also known as `paragraph vectors`, this is the latest and greatest in a series of papers by Google, looking into dense vector representations of documents. The `gensim` library in python has an implementation of `word2vec` that is straightforward enough that it can pretty reasonably be leveraged to build `doc2vec`, but make sure to keep the license in mind if you want to go down this route&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope that helps, let me know if you've got any questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko_allocation&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf" />

Example generative models are RBM's, autoencoders (in that case, which model has the lowest reconstruction error). There are likely some bayesian generative models also that will assign a probability to a data point based on some training data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best option though would be to take time to curate a second dataset containing only ham.

I have talked to other people who have said the same thing. It's also been used to win a number of the SemEval competitions for measuring semantic similarity between documents, often in combinations with a wordnet based measure, so I wouldn't say it's going out of fashion, or is definitely inferior to LDA, which is better for topic modelling and not semantic similarity in my experience, contrary to what some responders have stated. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you use gensim (a python library), it has LSA, LDA and word2vec, so you can easily compare the 3. doc2vec is a cool idea, but does not scale very well and you will likely have to implement it yourself as I am unaware of any open source implementations. It does not scale well as for each document, a new and separate model has to be built using SGD, a slow machine learning algorithm. But it will probably give you the most accurate results. LSA and LDA also don't scale well (word2vec does however), LDA scales worse in general. Gensim's implementations are very fast however, as it uses iterative SVD.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One other note, if you use word2vec, you will still have to determine a way to compose vectors from documents, as it gives you a different vector per word. The simplest way to do this is to normalize each vector and take the mean over all word vectors in the document, or take a weighted mean by idf weighting of each word. So it's not as simple as 'use word2vec', you will need to do something further to compute document similarity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would personally go with LSA, as I have seen it work well empirically, and gensim's library scales very well. However, there's no free lunch, so preferably try each method and see which works better for your data." />

Text="In my university, we have an HPC computing cluster. I use the cluster to train classifiers and so on.

Usually what happens is that I write the python script on my laptop and then I login to the server and update the SVN repository, so I get the same python script there. Then I write that Bash script or edit it, so I can run the bash script.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you see this is really frustrating since, for every little update for the python script, I need to do many steps to have it executed at the computing cluster. Of course the task gets even more complicated when I have to put the data on the server and use the datasets' path on the server.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm sure many people here are using computing clusters for their data science tasks.

A simple approach is to use an interface that allows multi-access to the machines in the cluster, like [clusterssh](http://sourceforge.net/projects/clusterssh/) (cssh). It allows you to type commands to multiple machines at once via a set of terminal screens (each one a ssh connection to a different machine in the cluster).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since your cluster seem to have `qsub` set up, your problem may be rather related to *replicating* the data along the machines (other than simply running a command in each node). So, to address this point, you may either write an `scp` script, to copy things to and from each node in the cluster (which is surely better addressed with SVN), or you may set up a NFS. This would allow for a simple and transparent access to the data, and also reduce the need for replicating unnecessary data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, you could access a node, copy the data to such place, and simply use the data *remotely*, via network communication. I'm not acquainted with how to set up a NFS, but you already have access to it (in case your home folder is the same across the machines you access). Then, the scripts and data could be sent to a single place, and later accessed from others. This is akin to the SVN approach, except it's more transparent/straightforward." />

Both files are under SVN control, and both machines have access to the same SVN server.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am sorry I do not have any advice specific to your grid system, but let me list some general points I have found important for any deployment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Keep production changes limited to configuration changes**. You write that you have to &quot;use the datasets' path on the server&quot;; this sounds to me like you have the paths hardcoded into your Python script.  This is not a good idea, precisely because you will need to change those paths in every other machine where you move the script to.  If you commit those changes back to SVN, then on your local machine you will have the remote paths, and on and on ...  (What if there are not only paths, but also passwords?  You should not have production passwords in an SVN server.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, keep paths and other setup informations in a `.ini` file and use [ConfigParser][1] to read it, or use a `.json` file and use the [json][2] module. Keep one copy of the file locally and one remotely, both under the same path, both without SVN control, and just keep the path to that configuration file in the Python script (or get it from the command line if you can't keep both configurations under the same path).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Keep configuration as small as possible**. Any configuration is a &quot;moving part&quot; of your application, and any system is more robust the less it has moving parts.  A good indicator of something that belongs into configuration is exactly that you have to edit it every time you move the code; things that have not needed editing can remain as constants in the code.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Automate your deployment**.  You can do it via a Bash script on your local machine; note that you can [run any command on a remote machine][3] through `ssh`.  For instance:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;!-- language: bash --&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    svn export yourprojectpath /tmp/exportedproject&#xD;&#xA;    tar czf /tmp/yourproject.tgz /tmp/exportedproject&#xD;&#xA;    scp /tmp/myproject.tgz youruser@remotemachine:~/dev&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ## Remote commands are in the right hand side, between ''&#xD;&#xA;    ssh youruser@remotemachine 'tar xzf ~/dev/yourproject.tgz'&#xD;&#xA;    ssh youruser@remotemachine 'qsub ~/dev/yourproject/script.py'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this to work, you need of course to have a [passwordless login][4], based on public/private keys, set up between your local and the remote machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you need more than this, you can think of using Python's [Fabric][5] or the higher-level [cuisine][6].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://malcontentcomics.com/systemsboy/2006/07/send-remote-commands-via-ssh.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.fabfile.org&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://github.com/sebastien/cuisine" />

Low-rank matrix factorization maps several rows (observed features) to a smaller set of rows (latent features).&#xD;&#xA;To elaborate, the document could have observed features (words) like [sail-boat, schooner, yatch, steamer, cruiser] which would 'factorize' to latent feature (topic) like 'ship' and 'boat'. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[sail-boat, schooner, yatch, steamer, cruiser, ...] -&gt; [ship, boat]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The underlying idea is that latent features are semantically relevant 'aggregates' of observered features.

Depending on whether *environments* for your set of experiments are represented by the **same model or different**, I see the following **approaches**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) **Single model approach.** *Define* experiments' statistical model for all environments (dependent and independent variables, data types, assumptions, constraints). *Analyze* it (most likely, using *regression analysis*). *Compare* results **across variables**, which determine (influence) different environments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) **Multiple models approach.** The same steps as previous case, but *compare* results **across models**, corresponding to different environments." />

And in general, all the other good things that software engineering has created along decades for ensuring isolation and reproductibility. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to stress that it is not enough to have *just* reproducible workflows, but also *easy* to reproduce workflows. Let me show what I mean. Suppose that your project uses Python, a database X and Scipy. Most surely you will be using a specific library to connect to your database from Python, and Scipy will be in turn using some sparse algebraic routines. This is by all means a very simple setup, but not entirely simple to setup, pun intended. If somebody wants to execute your scripts, she will have to install all the dependencies. Or worse, she might have incompatible versions of it already installed. Fixing those things takes time. It will also take time to you if you at some moment need to move your computations to a cluster, to a different cluster, or to some cloud servers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is where I find docker useful. Docker is a way to formalize and compile recipes for binary environments. You can write the following in a dockerfile (I'm using here plain English instead of the Dockerfile syntax):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Start with a basic binary environment, like Ubuntu's&#xD;&#xA;* Install libsparse-dev&#xD;&#xA;* (Pip) Install numpy and scipy&#xD;&#xA;* Install X&#xD;&#xA;* Install libX-dev&#xD;&#xA;* (Pip) Install python-X&#xD;&#xA;* Install IPython-Notebook&#xD;&#xA;* Copy my python scripts/notebooks to my binary environment, these datafiles, and these configurations to do other miscellaneous things. To ensure reproductibility, copy them from a named url instead of a local file. &#xD;&#xA;* Maybe run IPython-Notebook.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the lines will be installing things in Python using pip, since pip can do a very clean work in selecting specific package versions. Check it out too!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that's it. If after you create your Dockerfile it can be built, then it can be built anywhere, by anybody (provided they also have access to your project-specific files, e.g. because you put them in a public url referenced from the Dockerfile). What is best, you can upload the resulting environment (called an &quot;image&quot;) to a public or private server (called a &quot;register&quot;) for other people to use. So, when you publish your workflow, you have both a fully reproducible recipe in the form of a Dockerfile, and an easy way for you or other people to reproduce what you do:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    docker run dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or if they want to poke around in your scripts and so forth:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    docker run -i -t dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme /bin/bash&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.docker.com/" />

The best way to fix this is by making atomic operations on your data instead of trying to read everything in at once.&#xD;&#xA; - **Storing data** - This is actually just another form of the earlier issue, by the time to get up to about `1TB`, you start having to look elsewhere for storage. AWS S3 is the most common resource, and `python` has the fantastic `boto` library to facilitate leading with large pieces of data.&#xD;&#xA; - **Network latency** - Moving data around between different services is going to be your bottleneck. There's not a huge amount you can do to fix this, other than trying to pick co-located resources and plugging into the wall." />

Generally the workflow savings don't outweigh the increased query-times though.&#xD;&#xA; - **Ease of Use** - I'm not saying that `SQL` databases are always hard to use, or that `cassandra` is the easiest thing in the world to set up, but in general `NOSQL` databases are easier to set up and use than `SQL` databases. `Mongo` is a particularly strong example of this, known for being one of the easiest database layers to use (outside of `sqlite`). `SQL` also deals with a lot of normalization and there's a large legacy of `SQL` best practices that just generally bogs down the development process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I might suggest you also check out [graph][2] databases such as [neo4j][3] that show really good performance for certain types of queries if you're looking into picking out a backend for your data science applications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.moredevs.ro/mysql-vs-mongodb-performance-benchmark/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.neo4j.org/" />

First though, let's talk about exactly what `AUC` is. Honestly, for being one of the most widely used efficacy metrics, it's surprisingly obtuse to figure out exactly how `AUC` works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;`AUC` stands for `Area Under the Curve`, which curve you ask? Well that would be the `ROC` curve. `ROC` stands for [Receiver Operating Characteristic][1], which is actually slightly non-intuitive. The implicit goal of `AUC` is to deal with situations where you have a very skewed sample distribution, and don't want to overfit to a single class.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A great example is in spam detection. Generally spam data sets are STRONGLY biased towards ham, or not-spam. If your data set is 90% ham, you can get a pretty damn good accuracy by just saying that every single email is ham, which is obviously something that indicates a non-ideal classifier. Let's start with a couple of metrics that are a little more useful for us, specifically the true positive rate (`TPR`) and the false positive rate (`FPR`):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![ROC axes][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now in this graph, `TPR` is specifically the ratio of true positive to all positives, and `FPR` is the ratio of false positives to all negatives. (Keep in mind, this is only for binary classification.) On a graph like this, it should be pretty straightforward to figure out that a prediction of all 0's or all 1's will result in the points of `(0,0)` and `(1,1)` respectively. If you draw a line through these lines you get something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Kind of like a triangle][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which looks basically like a diagonal line (it is), and by some easy geometry, you can see that the `AUC` of such a model would be `0.5` (height and base are both 1). Similarly, if you predict a random assortment of 0's and 1's, let's say 90% 1's, you could get the point `(0.9, 0.9)`, which again falls along that diagonal line.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now comes the interesting part. What if we weren't only predicting 0's and 1's? What if instead we wanted to say that, theoretically we were going to set a cutoff, above which every result was a 1, and below which every result were a 0. This would mean that at the extremes you get the original situation where you have all 0's and all 1's (at a cutoff of 0 and 1 respectively), but also a series of intermediate states that fall within the `1x1` graph that contains your `ROC`. In practice you get something like this:&#xD;&#xA;![Courtesy of Wikipedia][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So basically, what you're actually getting when you do an `AUC` over accuracy is something that will strongly discourage people going for models that are representative, but not discriminative, as this will only actually select for models that achieve false positive and true positive rates that are significantly above random chance, which is not guaranteed for accuracy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/hNxTl.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/B1WT1.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/13McM.png" />

Based on my experience:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If you're trying to build a representative model -- one that describes the data rather than necessarily predicts -- then I would suggest using a representative sample of your data.&#xD;&#xA; - If you want to build a predictive model, particularly one that performs well by measure of AUC or rank-order and plan to use a basic ML framework (i.e. Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc), then I would suggest you feed the framework a balanced dataset.

For basic analytics and reporting statistics will certainly help, but for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence then you'll want a few more skills&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Probability theory** - you must have a solid background in pure probability so that you can decompose any problem, whether seen before or not, into probabilistic principles.  Statistics helps a lot for already solved problems, but new and unsolved problems require a deep understanding of probability so that you can design appropriate techniques.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Information Theory** - this (relative to statistics) is quite a new field (though still decades old), the most important work was by Shannon, but even more important and often neglected note in literature is work by Hobson that proved that Kullback-Leibler Divergence is the only mathematical definition that truly captures the notion of a *&quot;measure of information&quot;*. Now fundamental to artificial intellgence is being able to quantify information.  Suggest reading &quot;Concepts in Statistical Mechanics&quot; - Arthur Hobson (very expensive book, only available in academic libraries).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Complexity Theory** - A big problem many Data Scientists face that do not have a solid complexity theory background is that their algorithms do not scale, or just take an extremely long time to run on large data.  Take PCA for example, many peoples favourite answer to the interview question &quot;how do you reduce the number of features in our dataset&quot;, but even if you tell the candidate &quot;the data set is really really really large&quot; they still propose various forms of PCA that are O(n^3).  If you want to stand out, you want to be able to solve each problem on it's own, NOT throw some text book solution at it designed a long time ago before Big Data was such a hip thing.  For that you need to understand how long things take to run, not only theoretically, but practically - so how to use a cluster of computers to distribute an algorithm, or which data structures take up less memory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Communication Skills** - A huge part of Data Science is understanding business.  Whether it's inventing a product driven by data science, or giving business insight driven by data science, being able to communicate well with both the Project and Product Managers, the tech teams, and your fellow data scientists is very important.  You can have an amazing idea, say an awesome AI solution, but if you cannot effectively (a) communicate WHY that will make the business money, (b) convince your collegues it will work and (c) explain to tech people how you need their help to build it, then it wont get done." />

There's one subtlety, though - job titles are too short to carry important context. Let me explain this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine LinkedIn profiles (which is pretty good source for data). Normally, they contain 4-10 sentences describing person's skills and qualifications. It's pretty likely that you find phrases like &quot;lead data scientist&quot; and &quot;professional knowledge of Matlab and R&quot; in a same profile, but it's very unlikely to also see &quot;junior Java developer&quot; in it. So we may say that &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; (as well as &quot;data scientist&quot; and &quot;Matlab&quot; and &quot;R&quot;) often occur in same contexts, but they are rarely found together with &quot;junior&quot; and &quot;Java&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Co-occurrence matrix shows exactly this. The more 2 words occur in same context, the more similar their vectors in the matrix will look like. And cosine distance is just a good way to measure this similarity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about job titles? Normally they are much shorter and don't actually create enough context to catch similarities. Luckily, you don't need source data to be titles themselves - you need to find similarities between skills in general, not specifically in titles. So you can simply build co-occurrence matrix from (long) profiles and then use it to measure similarity of titles. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*** - in fact, it's already worked for me on a similar project.

Normally one merely selects the rank (number of features) without regard to what the features represent, and the algorithm does the rest. Like PCA, the result is not immediately interpretable but it yields good results. What you want to do is extend the movie matrix to include the additional features you mentioned and make sure that they stay fixed as the algorithm estimates the two matrices using regularizastion. The corresponding entries in the user matrix will be initialized randomly, then estimated by the matrix factorization algorithm. It's a versatile and performant approach but it takes some understanding of machine learning, or linear algebra at least.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I saw a nice ipython notebook a while back but I can't find it right now, so I'll refer you to [another one](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/diktat/CPSC540machinelearning/blob/master/1.4%20Collaborative%20Filtering%20for%20Movie%20Recommendation.ipynb) which, while not as nice, still clarifies some of the maths." />

Lambda is completely self-containing, so it's easy to copy its binary representation to other nodes without any worries. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now let's make things a bit more interesting: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    f = open(&quot;/etc/hosts&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;    rdd = sc.parallelize(range(100))&#xD;&#xA;    rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: f.read())&#xD;&#xA;    rdd.collect()&#xD;&#xA;    f.close()&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Boom!

Without actual data and knowing record format, I cannot debug it completely, but I guess that problem goes from this line: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def vectorizer(text, vocab=vocab_dict):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Python, keyword arguments are initialized when function is called for the first time. When you call `sc.parallelize(...).map(vectorizer)` just after its definition, `vocab_dict` is available _locally_, but _remote_ workers know absolutely nothing about it. Thus function is called with fewer parameters than it expects which results in `__init__() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)` error. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note, that you follow very bad pattern of  `sc.parallelize(...)...collect()` calls. First you spread your collection to entire cluster, do some computations, and then pull the result. But sending data back and forth is pretty pointless here. Instead, you can just do these computations locally, and run Spark's parallel processes only when you work with really big datasets (like you main `amazon_dataset`, I guess)." />

Added some context. Removed unnecessary formatting. " Text="To be perfectly honest, most NoSQL databases are not very well suited to applications in big data. For the vast majority of all big data applications, the performance of MongoDB compared to a relational database like [MySQL][1] is [significantly][2] is poor enough to warrant staying away from something like MongoDB entirely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that said, there are a couple of really useful properties of NoSQL databases that certainly work in your favor when you're working with large data sets, though the chance of those benefits outweighing the generally poor performance of NoSQL compared to [SQL][3] for read-intensive operations (most similar to typical big data use cases) is low.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **No Schema** - If you're working with a lot of unstructured data, it might be hard to actually decide on and rigidly apply a schema. NoSQL databases in general are very supporting of this, and will allow you to insert schema-less documents on the fly, which is certainly not something an SQL database will support.&#xD;&#xA; - **[JSON][4]** - If you happen to be working with JSON-style documents instead of with [CSV][5] files, then you'll see a lot of advantage in using something like MongoDB for a database-layer. Generally the workflow savings don't outweigh the increased query-times though.&#xD;&#xA; - **Ease of Use** - I'm not saying that SQL databases are always hard to use, or that [Cassandra][6] is the easiest thing in the world to set up, but in general NoSQL databases are easier to set up and use than SQL databases. MongoDB is a particularly strong example of this, known for being one of the easiest database layers to use (outside of [SQLite][7]). SQL also deals with a lot of normalization and there's a large legacy of SQL best practices that just generally bogs down the development process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I might suggest you also check out [graph databases][8] such as [Neo4j][9] that show really good performance for certain types of queries if you're looking into picking out a backend for your data science applications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.moredevs.ro/mysql-vs-mongodb-performance-benchmark/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

In particular, I would recommend that you explore the possibility of using [word2vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) features as inputs to your CRF.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Word2vec trains a  to distinguish between words that are appropriate for a given context and words that are randomly selected.  Select weights of the model can then be interpreted as a dense vector representation of a given word.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These dense vectors have the appealing property that words that are semantically or syntactically similar have similar vector representations.  Basic vector arithmetic even reveals some interesting learned relationships between words.  &#xD;&#xA;For example, vector(&quot;Paris&quot;) - vector(&quot;France&quot;) + vector(&quot;Italy&quot;) yields a vector that is quite similar to vector(&quot;Rome&quot;).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At a high level, you can think of word2vec representations as being similar to LDA or LSA representations, in the sense that you can convert a sparse input vector into a dense output vector that contains word similarity information. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For that matter, LDA and LSA are also valid options for unsupervised feature learning -- both attempt to represent words as combinations of &quot;topics&quot; and output dense word representations.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For English text Google distributes word2vec models pretrained on a huge 100 billion word Google News dataset, but for other languages you'll have to train your own model.&#xD;&#xA;" />

It uses machine learning, statistics and other fields to simplify (or even automate) decision making. Data science techniques may work with any data size, but more data means better predictions and thus more precise decisions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Hadoop** is a common name for a set of tools intended to work with large amounts of data. Two most important components in Hadoop are HDFS and MapReduce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**HDFS**, or Hadoop Distributed File System, is a special distributed storage capable of holding really large data amounts. Large files on HDFS are split into blocks, and for each block HDFS API exposes its _location_. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**MapReduce** is framework for running computations on nodes with data. MapReduce heavily uses _data locality_ exposed by HDFS: when possible, data is not transferred between nodes, but instead code is copied to the nodes with data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So basically any problem (including data science tasks) that doesn't break data locality principle may be efficiently implemented using MapReduce (and a number of other problems may be solved not that efficiently, but still simply enough).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's take some examples. Very often analyst only needs some simple statistics over his tabular data. In this case [**Hive**](https://hive.apache.org/), which is basically SQL engine over MapReduce, works pretty well (there are also Impala, Shark and others, but they don't use Hadoop's MapReduce, so more on them later). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other cases analyst (or developer) may want to work with previously unstructured data. Pure MapReduce is pretty good for **transforming** and **standardizing** data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some people are used to exploratory statistics and visualization using tools like R. It's possible to apply this approach to big data amounts using [**RHadoop**](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki) package. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And when it comes to MapReduce-based machine learning [**Apache Mahout**](https://mahout.apache.org/) is the first to mention. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's, however, one type of algorithms that work pretty slowly on Hadoop even in presence of data locality, namely, iterative algorithms. Iterative algorithms tend to have multiple Map and Reduce stages. Hadoop's MR framework **reads** and **writes** data to disk on each stage (and sometimes in between), which makes iterative (as well as any multi-stage) tasks terribly slow. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fortunately, there are alternative frameworks that can both - use data locality and keep data in memory between stages. Probably, the most notable of them is [**Apache Spark**](https://spark.apache.org/). Spark is complete replacement for Hadoop's MapReduce that uses its own runtime and exposes pretty rich API for manipulating your distributed dataset. Spark has several sub-projects, closely related to data science: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * [**Shark**](http://shark.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [**Spark SQL**](https://spark.apache.org/sql/)  provide alternative SQL-like interfaces to data stored on HDFS&#xD;&#xA; * [**Spark Streaming**](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/) makes it easy to work with continuous data streams (e.g. Twitter feed)&#xD;&#xA; * [**MLlib**](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/) implements a number of machine learning algorithms with a pretty simple and flexible API&#xD;&#xA; * [**GraphX**](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/) enables large-scale graph processing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So there's pretty large set of data science problems that you can solve with Hadoop and related projects.

To be more precise, it works best when the result can be found from the result of some function of a partition of the input.

I could limit the input neurons just to the words used in the set, but then could it grow/learn by adding new movies (user watches a new movie, with new words)? Most of the libraries I've seen don't allow adding new neurons after the system has been trained?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there a standard way to map string/word/character data to inputs into a neural network?

In other words, you have a vector of length n, where n is the number of words in your vocabulary, and each word corresponds to an element in the vector.  In order to convert text to numeric data, you simply count the number of occurrences of each word and place that value at the index of the vector that corresponds to the word. [Wikipedia does an excellent job of describing this conversion process.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model.)  Because the length of the vector is fixed, its difficult to deal with new words that don't map to an index, but there are ways to help mitigate this problem (lookup [feature hashing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing)).  &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;This method of representation has many disadvantages -- it does not preserve the relationship between adjacent words, and results in very sparse vectors.  Looking at [n-grams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) helps to fix the problem of preserving word relationships, but for now let's focus on the second problem: sparsity.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's difficult to deal directly with these sparse vectors (many linear algebra libraries do a poor job of handling sparse inputs), so often the next step is dimensionality reduction. For that we can refer to the field of [topic modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model):  Techniques like [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) (LDA) and [Latent Semantic Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis) (LSA) allow the compression of these sparse vectors into dense vectors by representing a document as a combination of topics.  You can fix the number of topics used, and in doing so fix the size of the output vector producted by LDA or LSA. This dimensionality reduction process drastically reduces the size of the input vector while attempting to lose a minimal amount of information.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, after all of these conversions, you can feed the outputs of the topic modeling process into the inputs of your neural network.

I hope it may help you to solve your problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'm planning to run some experiments with very large data sets, and I'd like to distribute the computation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [one of my posts][1], I have done research on topic of _evaluation methods of Data Science_. With __Learning Curve__, you can evaluate your experiments _learning ability_. To talk a bit more, you will __fix__ commodity configuration, and then will run same experiment on the same number of machines with different size of data set you have (from starting from small chunk in size, incrementally increase the size until you reach the whole data set). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To point on, you should avoid having _power distribution_ for result of performance test being run with different size of data sets. To avoid, you should carefully choose _step size_ (step size = amount of increments).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I have about ten machines available, each with 200 GB of free space on hard disk. However, I would like to perform experiments on a greater number of nodes, to measure scalability more precisely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this type question, I have intuitively searched and read materials; afterwards, published as a [blog post][2]. At the end of the post, I have briefly talked about how to test your hypothesis on real complex system. If you let me, I want to briefly talk about;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, __base requirement__ should be formed in order to run data set as a whole. The minimum requirement will build your __baseline evaluation score__ which is calculated with one/combination of evaluation metrics you have chosen, or with one/combination of methods being used to calculate `Running Time = Computation complexity + Communication cost + Synchronization cost`. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After those steps, with an _evaluation strategy_, add new elements, e.g. new node, to the system you have doing scalability test; meanwhile, for each addition, measure performance w.r.t new system configuration. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just to note, _evaluation strategy_ must be planned along with considerations of default behavior of parallel and distributed systems. For example, what I mean by behavior is that adding just more cores will, after some point, automatically drop performance of the system not due to your algorithm characteristics. It is because more cores need more RAMs, more hard driver, or etc. In other words, there is a __N-Way__ relationship between hardware components. As a second example, adding more nodes to the distributed system will punished you with more communication and synchronization costs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a last step, you will sketch two different graphs with your evaluation results via data analysis program or language (As a recommendation, use GNU Plot or R programming language). Print out and put those results at your desktop, and start to examine them, carefully. According to your investigation, modify/erase + rebuild _evaluation strategy_ and re-do the performance test.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are there commodity services which would grant me that only my application would be running at a given time? Has anyone used such services yet?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have no much experiment on commodity services, but I can easily say whether it grants or not depends on your configuration of services. If you configured say Hadoop to your node as an only service, Hadoop will grant your code will be only running at any time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/meeting-justice-of-data-science&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/scale-your-vision" />

My first question to them was what these users' profiles looked like and how they were different from those who stayed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Advertising is only top of an iceberg. User profiles (either filled by users themselves or computed from users' behaviour) hold information about: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **user categories**, i.e. what kind of people tend to use your website/product&#xD;&#xA; - **paying client portraits**, i.e. who is more likely to use your paid services&#xD;&#xA; - **UX component performance**, e.g. how long it takes people to find the button they need&#xD;&#xA; - **action performance comparison**, e.g. what was more efficient - lower price for a weekend or propose gifts with each buy, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it's more about improving product and making better user experience rather than selling this data to advertisers.

Most will use it internally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;User tracking data is important for understanding a lot of things.  There's basic A/B testing where you provide different experiences to see which is more effective.  There is understanding how your UI is utilized.  Categorizing your end users in different ways for a variety of reasons.  Figuring out where your end user base is, and within that group where the end users that matter are.  Correlating user experiences with social network updates.  Figuring out what will draw people to your product and what drives them away.  The list of potential for data mining and analysis projects could go on for days.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Data storage is cheap.  If you track everything out of the gate, you can figure out what you want to do with that data later.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Scanning text messages is sketchy territory when there isn't a good reason for it.  Even when there is a good reason it's sketchy territory.  I'd love to say that nobody does it, but there have been instances where big companies have done it and there are a lot of cases where no-name apps at least require access to that kind of data for installation.  I generally frown on that kind of thing myself as a consumer, but the data analyst in me would love to see if I could build anything useful from a set of information like that." />

Different models, such as random forests, regression, etc. could capture only part of relations and ignore others. In such circumstances it makes sense to use general **statistical exploration** and **modelling**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, the very first thing I would do is finding out **correlations** between possible precursor conditions and diagnoses. E.g. in what percent of cases chronic kidney disease was preceded by long flu? If it is high, it [doesn't always mean causality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation), but gives pretty good food for thought and helps to better understand relations between different conditions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another important step is data visualisation. Does CKD happens in males more often than in females? What about their place of residence? What is distribution of CKD cases by age? It's hard to grasp large dataset as a set of numbers, plotting them out makes it much easier. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you have an idea of what's going on, perform [**hypothesis testing**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) to check your assumption. If you reject null hypothesis (basic assumption) in favour of alternative one, congratulations, you've made &quot;something real&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, when you have a good understanding of your data, try to create complete **model**. It may be something general like [PGM](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm) (e.g. manually-crafted Bayesian network), or something more specific like linear regression or [SVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine), or anything. But in any way you will already know how this model corresponds to your data and how you can measure its efficiency. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---- &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a good starting resource for learning statistical approach I would recommend [Intro to Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/st101) course by Sebastian Thrun. While it's pretty basic and doesn't include advanced topics, it describes most important concepts and gives systematic understanding of probability theory and statistics. " />

For example, my original data looked something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    DATE        SPEED  &#xD;&#xA;    12/31/2012   22&#xD;&#xA;    12/31/2012   25&#xD;&#xA;    12/31/2012   23&#xD;&#xA;    ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and the final looked like this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    DATE        SPEED &#xD;&#xA;    10/1/2012    22&#xD;&#xA;    10/2/2012    23&#xD;&#xA;    10/3/2012    22&#xD;&#xA;    ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only problem, is my data is supposed to start at 9/1/2012. I plotted this data, and it turns out the data goes from 10/1/2012-12/31/2012 and then 9/1/2012-9/30/2012.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What in the world is going on here?" />

After importing, your DATE column is of either `character`, or `factor` class (depending on your settings for `stringsAsFactors`). Therefore, I think that you can solve this issue in at least several ways, as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) **Convert data** to correct type **during import**. To do this, just use the following options of `read.csv()`: `stringsAsFactors` (or `as.is`) and `colClasses`. By default, you can specify conversion to `Date` or `POSIXct` classes. If you need a non-standard format, you have two options. First, if you have a single Date column, you can use `as.Date.character()` to pass the desired format to `colClasses`. Second, if you have multiple Date columns, you can write a function for that and pass it to `colClasses` via `setAs()`. Both options are discussed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13022299/specify-date-format-for-colclasses-argument-in-read-table-read-csv.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) **Convert data** to correct format **after import**. Thus, after calling `read.csv()`, you would have to execute the following code: `dateColumn &lt;- as.Date(dateColumn, &quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;)` or `dateColumn &lt;- strptime(dateColumn, &quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;)` (adjust the format to whatever Date format you need)." />

The types may include: geographic locations (countries, cities, rivers, ...), person names, organization names etc. Before going into NER task you must understand what do you want to get and, possible, predefine a taxonomy of named entity types to resolve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Coreference Resolution][10] - to group named entities (or, depending on your task, any other text units) into clusters corresponding to a single real object/meaning. For example, &quot;B. Gates&quot;, &quot;William Gates&quot;, &quot;Founder of Microsoft&quot; etc. in one text may mean the same person, referenced by using different expressions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There're many other interesting NLP applications/annotators (see [NLP tasks category][11]), sentiment analysis, machine translation etc.).

The sample must be **representative**. In expectation, at least, the distribution of features in your sample must match the distribution of features in the population. When you are fitting a model with a response variable, *this includes features that you do not observe, but that affect any response variables in your model*. Since it is, in many cases, impossible to know what you do not observe, **random sampling** is used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The idea with randomization is that a random sample, up to sampling error, *must* accurately reflect the distribution of all features in the population, observed and otherwise. This is why **randomization is the &quot;gold standard,&quot;** but if sample control is available by some other technique, or it is defensible to argue that there are no omitted features, then it isn't always necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Your sample must be **large enough** that the effect of **sampling error** on the feature distribution is relatively small. This is, again, to ensure representativeness. But deciding who to sample is different from deciding how many people to sample.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it sounds like you're fitting a model, there's the additional consideration that certain important combinations of features could be relatively rare in the population. This is not an issue for generalizability, but it bears heavily on your considerations for sample size. For instance, I'm working on a project now with (non-big) data that was originally collected to understand the experiences of minorities in college. As such, it was critically important to ensure that **statistical power** was high *specifically in the minority subpopulation*. For this reason, blacks and Latinos were deliberately **oversampled**. However, the proportion by which they were oversampled was also recorded. These are used to compute survey weights. These can be used to  re-weight the sample so as to reflect the estimated population proportions, in the event that a representative sample is required.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An additional consideration arises if your model is hierarchical. A canonical use for a hierarchical model is one of children's behavior in schools. Children are &quot;grouped&quot; by school and share school-level traits. Therefore a representative sample of schools is required, and within each school a representative sample of children is required. This leads to **stratified sampling**. This and some other sampling designs are reviewed in surprising depth on [Wikipedia][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods" />

And then we check how far away from uniform the actual values are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There also exists a [Crammer's V][2] that is a measure of correlation that follows from this test&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Example &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose we have two variables&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; - gender: male and female&#xD;&#xA; - city: Blois and Tours&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We observed the following data:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![observed values][3] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are gender and city independent? Let's perform a Chi-Squred test. Null hypothesis: they are independent, Alternative hypothesis is that they are correlated in some way. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Under the Null hypothesis, we assume uniform distribution. So our expected values are the following&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![expected value][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So we run the chi-squared test and the resulting p-value here can be seen as a measure of correlation between these two variables.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To compute Crammer's V we first find the normalizing factor chi-squared-max which is typically the size of the sample, divide the chi-square by it and take a square root &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![crammers v][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### R &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    tbl = matrix(data=c(55, 45, 20, 30), nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=T)&#xD;&#xA;    dimnames(tbl) = list(City=c('B', 'T'), Gender=c('M', 'F'))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    chi2 = chisq.test(tbl, correct=F)&#xD;&#xA;    c(chi2$statistic, chi2$p.value)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here the p value is 0.08 - quite small, but still not enough to reject the hypothesis of independence.

You can run such a regression using R without any special efforts for sparse data. Just use the `lm()` command (for &quot;linear model&quot;). Use `?lm` to see the help page. And note that `lm` will by default silently add a constant column of ones to your design matrix (the intercept) - include a `-1` on the right hand side of your formula to suppress this. Overall, assuming all your data (and nothing else) is in a `data.frame` called `foo`, you can do this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    model &lt;- lm(y~.-1,data=foo)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And then you can look at parameter estimates etc. like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    summary(model)&#xD;&#xA;    residuals(model)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*If* your system is *much* larger, say on the order of 10,000 observations and hundreds of predictors, looking at specialized sparse solvers as per [Aleksandr's answer][1] may start to make sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, in your comment to [Aleksandr's answer][1], you mention constraints on your equation. If that is actually your key issue, there are ways to calculate constrained least squares in R. I personally like `pcls()` in the `mgcv` package. Perhaps you want to edit your question to include the type of constraints (box constraints, nonnegativity constraints, integrality constraints, linear constraints, ...) you face?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2853" />

In Java an exception can have several causing exceptions, and the whole must be analyzed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, given the following example exception:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    com.myapp.CustomException: Error printing ...&#xD;&#xA;    ... (stack)&#xD;&#xA;    Caused by: com.foo.webservice.RemoteException: Unable to communicate ...&#xD;&#xA;    ... (stack)&#xD;&#xA;    Caused by: com.acme.PrintException: PrintServer002: Timeout ....&#xD;&#xA;    ... (stack)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, our algorithm splits the whole stack in three isolated exceptions. Afterwards it starts analyzing these exceptions starting from the most inner one. In this case, it determines that this exception (the second caused by) is of type `Availability` and that the responsible component is a &quot;print server&quot;. This is because there is a rule that matches containing the word `Timeout` associated to the `Availability` type. There is also a rule that matches `com.acme.PrintException` and determines that the responsible component is a print server. As all the information needed is determined using only the most inner exception, the upper exceptions are ignored, but this is not always the case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see this kind of approximation is very complex (and chaotic) as a human have to create new rules as new exceptions appear. Besides, the new rules have to be compatible with the current ones because a new rule for classifying a new exception must not change the classification of any of the already classified exceptions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We are thinking about using Machine Learning to automate this process. Obviously, I am not asking for a solution here as I know the complexity but I'd really appreciate some advice to achieve our goal." />

That just seems wrong :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there a canonical test to use for A/B tests with small #'s of clicks?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Interpretation and R code**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've used the following R code to test significance for each position:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Position 1:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    binom.test(7, 767, p=(26/753))&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Exact binomial test&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    data:  7 and 767&#xD;&#xA;    number of successes = 7, number of trials = 767, p-value = 1.077e-05&#xD;&#xA;    alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.03452855&#xD;&#xA;    95 percent confidence interval:&#xD;&#xA;     0.003676962 0.018713125&#xD;&#xA;    sample estimates:&#xD;&#xA;    probability of success &#xD;&#xA;               0.009126467&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;I interpret this result to mean: The probability of success in the test group is indeed different than the control group with a 95% confidence interval that the success probability is between .368% and 1.87%&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ppois(((26-1)/753), lambda=(7/767), lower.tail = F)&#xD;&#xA;    [1] 0.009084947&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I interpret this result to mean: Given a Poisson distribution with a click rate of 7 per 767 trials, there is a 0.9% chance of having a click rate of 26 or more per 753 trials in the same distribution. Contextualized in the ad example,&#xD;&#xA;there is a .1% chance that the control ad actually performs the same as the test ad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is the above interpretation correct? Does the test and interpretation change with the different positions (i.e. are the results of the Poisson test more appropriate for Position 3 given the small numbers)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Dataset to train and test on.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Algorithm(s) to handle these data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Training dataset consists of a set of pairs `(x, y)`, where `x` is a **vector of features** and `y` is **predicted variable**. Predicted variable is just what you want to know, i.e. in your case it is exception type. Features are more tricky. You cannot just throw raw text into an algorithm, you need to extract meaningful parts of it and organize them as feature vectors first. You've already mentioned a couple of useful features - exception class name (e.g. `com.acme.PrintException`) and contained words (&quot;Timeout&quot;). All you need is to translate your row exceptions (and human-categorized exception types) into suitable dataset, e.g.: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ex_class                  contains_timeout  ...   | ex_type&#xD;&#xA;    -----------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;    [com.acme.PrintException, 1                , ...] | Availability&#xD;&#xA;    [java.lang.Exception    , 0                , ...] | Network&#xD;&#xA;     ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This representation is already much better for ML algorithms. But which one to take? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taking into account nature of the task and your current approach natural choice is to use **decision trees**. This class of algorithms will compute optimal decision criteria for all your exception types and print out resulting tree. This is especially useful, because you will have possibility to manually inspect how decision is made and see how much it corresponds to your manually-crafted rules. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's, however, possibility that some exceptions with exactly the same features will belong to different exception types. In this case probabilistic approach may work well. Despite its name, **Naive Bayes** classifier works pretty well in most cases. There's one issue with NB and our dataset representation, though: dataset contains *categorical* variables, and Naive Bayes can work with *numerical* attributes only*. Standard way to overcome this problem is to use [dummy variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_%28statistics%29). In short, dummy variables are binary variables that simply indicate whether specific category presents or not. For example, single variable `ex_class` with values `{com.acme.PrintException, java.lang.Exception, ...}`, etc. may be split into several variables `ex_class_printexception`, `ex_class_exception`, etc. with values `{0, 1}`:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ex_class_printexception  ex_class_exception  contains_timeout | ex_type&#xD;&#xA;    -----------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;    [1,                    , 0                 , 1              ] | Availability&#xD;&#xA;    [0,                    , 1                 , 0              ] | Network&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One last algorithm to try is **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. It neither provides helpful visualisation, nor is probabilistic, but often gives superior results. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*** - in fact, neither Bayes theorem, nor Naive Bayes itself state anything about variable type, but most software packages that come to mind rely on numerical features.

These kinds of tests are generally used when we _know_ what the inherent probability is that we're comparing to (e.g. to see if the set of coin flips has a probability significantly different from 1/2 which is what we expect from a fair coin). In this case, we don't _know_ what the probability is that we're comparing to, we're just making the very crude guess that the 26/753 outcome of row 1 reflects the true probability. It's better than a regular Normal t-test in this case, but don't put _too_ much stock in it unless you have a much higher sample size for row 1." />

For example, someone may write &quot;xxx cheated their clients, and now they are cheated themselves! ha ha ha! :D&quot;.

Confirmatory factor analysis was implemented as a maximum likelihood estimation technique, and I could see very easily how the computation time grew with each dimension (sample size `n`, number of variables `p`, number of factors `k`). As it is heavily dependent on how Stata thinks about the data (optimized to compute across columns/observations rather than rows), I found performance to be `O(n^{0.68} (k+p)^{2.4})` where 2.4 is the fastest matrix inversion asymptotics (and there's hell of a lot of that in confirmatory factor analysis iterative maximization). I did not give a reference for the latter, but I think I got this from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations#Matrix_algebra).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there is also a matrix inversion step in OLS. However, for reasons of numerical accuracy, no one would really brute-force inverse the `X'X` matrix, and would rather use sweep operators and identify the dangerously collinear variables to deal with precision issues. If you add up $10^8$ numbers that originally were in [double precision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format), you will likely end up with a number that only has a single precision.

To me this seems reasonable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What seems simple at first glance is actually a bit tricky - to maintain identifiers across time steps. Let me try to make this point clear with a more borderline example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The green point will cause two blue and two red points to be merged into one cluster which I arbitrarily decided to color blue - mind this is already my human heuristical thinking at work!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A computer to make this decision will have to use rules. For example when points are merged into a cluster then the identity of the cluster is determined by the majority. In this case we would face a draw - both blue and red might be valid choices for the new (here blue colored) cluster. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine a fifth red point close to the green one. Then the majority would be red (3 red vs 2 blue) so red would be a good choice for the new cluster - but this would contradict the even clearer choice of red for the rightmost cluster as those have been red and probably should stay that way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I find it fishy to think about this. At the end of the day I guess there are no perfect rules for this - rather heuristics optimizing some stability criterea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This finally leads to my questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

They're defined as part of generating the topic models. With a non-deterministic algorithm like LDA, you'll get different topics each time you run the algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Text classification often involves mutually-exclusive classes -- think of these as buckets. But it doesn't have to -- given the right kind of labeled input data, you can set of a series of non-mutually-exclusive binary classifiers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Topic modeling is generally not mutually-exclusive -- the same document can have its probability distribution spread across many topics.

Note, the *licensing* - if you plan to use their code in commercial products, you have to acquire commercial license.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another interesting set of open source libraries, IMHO suitable for this task and much more, is **parallel framework for machine learning GraphLab** (http://select.cs.cmu.edu/code/graphlab), which includes **clustering library**, implementing various clustering algorithms (http://select.cs.cmu.edu/code/graphlab/clustering.html). It is especially suitable for **very large volume of data** (like you have), as it implements `MapReduce` model and, thus, supports *multicore* and *multiprocessor* **parallel processing**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You most likely are aware of the following, but I will mention it just in case. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** for `Python` (http://www.nltk.org) contains modules for clustering/classifying/categorizing text. Check the relevant chapter in the `NLTK Book`: http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Speaking of **algorithms**, it seems that you've tried most of the ones from `scikit-learn`, such as illustrated in this topic extraction example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/topics_extraction_with_nmf.html. However, you may find useful other libraries, which implement a wide variety of *clustering algorithms*, including *Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)*. One of such libraries is **Python Matrix Factorization (PyMF)** with home page at https://code.google.com/p/pymf and source code at https://github.com/nils-werner/pymf. Another, even more interesting, library, also Python-based, is **NIMFA**, which implements various *NMF algorithms*: http://nimfa.biolab.si. Here's a research paper, describing `NIMFA`: http://jmlr.org/papers/volume13/zitnik12a/zitnik12a.pdf. Here's an example from its documentation, which presents the solution for very similar text processing problem of *topic clustering*: http://nimfa.biolab.si/nimfa.examples.documents.html." />

My current approach is to use tf-idf weighted term frequencies and learn a simple linear classifier (logistic regression). This works reasonably well (around 90% macro F-1 on test set, nearly 100% on training set). A big problem are unseen words/n-grams. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am trying to improve the classifier by adding other features, e.g. a fixed sized vector computed using distributional similarities (as computed by word2vec) or other categorical features of the examples. My idea was to just add the features to the sparse input features from the bag of words. However, this results in worse performance on the test and training set. The additional features by themselves give about 80% F-1 on the test set, so they aren't garbage. Scaling the features didn't help as well. My current thinking is that these kind of features don't mix well with the (sparse) bag of words features.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the question is: assuming the additional features provide additional information, what is the best way to incorporate them?

The other 92 vectors are very similar too, though _none_ of weights are _exactly_ the same. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can overcome this by increasing number of weight vectors to 512 or more.

If, for example, you have 1000 sparse features only 3 or 4 of which are active in each instance (and the others are zeros) and 20 dense features that are all non-zeros, then it's pretty likely that dense features will make most of the impact while sparse features will add only a little value. You can check this by looking at feature weights for a few instances and how they influence resulting sum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way to fix it is to go away from additive model. Here's a couple of candidate models. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**SVM** is based on separating hyperplanes. Though hyperplane is linear model itself, SVM doesn't sum up its parameters, but instead tries to split feature space in an optimal way. Given the number of features, I'd say that linear SVM should work fine while more complicated kernels may tend to overfit the data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Despite its name, **Naive Bayes** is pretty powerful statistical model that showed good results for text classification. It's also flexible enough to capture imbalance in frequency of sparse and dense features, so you should definitely give it a try. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, **random forests** may work as a good ensemble method in this case. Randomization will ensure that different kinds of features (sparse/dense) will be used as primary decision nodes in different trees. RF/decision trees are also good for inspecting features themselves, so it's worth to note their structure anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that all of these methods have their drawbacks that may turn them into a garbage in your case. Combing sparse and dense features isn't really well-studied task, so let us know what of these approaches works best for your case. " />

You have to provide more details. If you're dealing with **bid data**, then this fact will most likely affect selection of preferred *tools*, *approaches* and *algorithms* for your **data analysis**. I hope that the following thoughts of mine on data analysis address your sub-questions. Please note that the numbering of my points does not match the numbering of your sub-questions. However, I believe that it better reflects general **data analysis workflow**, at least, how I understand it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Firstly, I think that you need to have at least some kind of **conceptual model** in mind (or, better, on paper). This model should guide you in your *exploratory data analysis (EDA)*. A presence of a *dependent variable (DV)* in the model means that in your *machine learning (ML)* phase later in the analysis you will deal with so called supervised ML, as opposed to unsupervised ML in the absence of an identified DV.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Secondly, **EDA** is a crucial part. IMHO, EDA should include **multiple iterations** of producing *descriptive statistics* and *data visualization*, as you refine your understanding about the data. Not only this phase will give you valuable insights about your datasets, but it will feed your next important phase - **data cleaning and transformation**. Just throwing your raw data into a statistical software package won't give much - for any **valid** statistical analysis, data should be *clean, correct and consistent*. This is often the most time- and effort-consuming, but absolutely necessary part. For more details on this topic, read these nice papers: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf (by Hadley Wickham) and http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf (by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Now, as you're hopefully done with *EDA* as well as data cleaning and transformation, your ready to start some more statistically-involved phases. One of such phases is *exploratory factor analysis (EFA)*, which will allow you to extract the underlying **structure** of your data. For datasets with large number of variables, the positive side effect of EFA is *dimensionality reduction*. And, while in that sense EFA is similar to *principal components analysis (PCA)* and other dimensionality reduction approaches, I think that EFA is more important as it allows to refine your conceptual model of the phenomena that your data &quot;describe&quot;, thus making sense of your datasets.

Text="I will try to answer your questions, but before I'd like to note that using term &quot;large dataset&quot; is misleading, as &quot;large&quot; is a *relative* concept. You have to provide more details. If you're dealing with **bid data**, then this fact will most likely affect selection of preferred *tools*, *approaches* and *algorithms* for your **data analysis**. I hope that the following thoughts of mine on data analysis address your sub-questions. Please note that the numbering of my points does not match the numbering of your sub-questions. However, I believe that it better reflects general **data analysis workflow**, at least, how I understand it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Firstly, I think that you need to have at least some kind of **conceptual model** in mind (or, better, on paper). This model should guide you in your *exploratory data analysis (EDA)*. A presence of a *dependent variable (DV)* in the model means that in your *machine learning (ML)* phase later in the analysis you will deal with so called supervised ML, as opposed to unsupervised ML in the absence of an identified DV.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Secondly, **EDA** is a crucial part. IMHO, EDA should include **multiple iterations** of producing *descriptive statistics* and *data visualization*, as you refine your understanding about the data. Not only this phase will give you valuable insights about your datasets, but it will feed your next important phase - **data cleaning and transformation**. Just throwing your raw data into a statistical software package won't give much - for any **valid** statistical analysis, data should be *clean, correct and consistent*. This is often the most time- and effort-consuming, but absolutely necessary part. For more details on this topic, read these nice papers: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf (by Hadley Wickham) and http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf (by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Now, as you're hopefully done with *EDA* as well as data cleaning and transformation, your ready to start some more statistically-involved phases. One of such phases is *exploratory factor analysis (EFA)*, which will allow you to extract the underlying **structure** of your data. For datasets with large number of variables, the positive side effect of EFA is *dimensionality reduction*. And, while in that sense EFA is similar to *principal components analysis (PCA)* and other dimensionality reduction approaches, I think that EFA is more important as it allows to refine your conceptual model of the phenomena that your data &quot;describe&quot;, thus making sense of your datasets. Of course, in addition to EFA, you can/should perform **regression analysis** as well as apply **machine learning techniques**, based on your findings in previous phases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, a note on **software tools**. In my opinion, current state of statistical software packages is at such point that practically any major software packages have comparable offerings feature-wise. If you study or work in an organization that have certain policies and preferences in term of software tools, then you are *constrained* by them.

Basically you need to estimate the respective class means and class covariances.  Now the first thing you care about is your estimate of the difference in the class means: but your performance is limited by the accuracy of the worst estimated mean: its no good estimating one mean to the 100th decimal place - if the other mean is only estimated to 1 decimal place.  So its a waste of computing resources to use all the data - you can instead undersample the  more common class AND reweight the classes appropriately. ( those computing resources can then be used exploring different input variables etc)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now the second issue is predictive accuracy: different algorithms use different error metrics, which may or may not agree with your own objectives. eg logistic regression will penalise overall probability error,  so if  most of your data is from one class, then it will tend to try to improve accurate probability estimates ( eg 90 vs 95% probability) of that one class rather than trying to identify the rare class. in that case you would definitely want to try to reweight to emphasize the rare class ( and subsequently adjust the estimate [by adjusting the bias term] to get the probability estimates realigned)&#xD;&#xA;" />

I am looking for an algorithm or a library that will convert each list into this canonical string.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is one such list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope | StarWars.com&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Watch Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope Online Free&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Star Wars (1977) - Greatest Films&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[REC] 4 poster promises death by outboard motor - SciFiNow&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this list, any string matching the regular expression `^Star Wars:? Episode IV (- )?A New Hope$` would be acceptable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have looked at Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera, but I was not able to find a similar problem." />

SPSS is a great tool, but you can accomplish a great deal with resources that you already have on your computer, like Excel, or that are free, like the R-project. Although these tools are powerful, and can help you identify patterns, you'll need to have a firm grasp of your data before running analyses (I'd recommend running descriptive statistics on your data, and exploring the data with graphs to make sure everything is looking normal). In other words, the tool that you use won't offer a &quot;silver bullet&quot;, because the output will only be as valuable as the input (you know the saying... &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;). Much of what I'm saying has already been stated in the reply by Aleksandr - spot on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. R can be challenging for those of us who aren't savvy with coding, but the free resources associated with R and its packages are abundant. If you practice learning the program, you'll quickly gain traction. Again, you'll need to be familiar with your data and the analyses you want to run anyway, and that fact remains regardless of the statistical tools you utilize. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. I'd begin by getting super familiar with my data (follow the steps outlined in the reply from Aleksandr, for starters). You might consider picking up John Foreman's book called Data Smart. It's a hands-on book, as John provides datasets and you follow along with his examples (using Excel) to learn various ways of navigating and exploring data. For beginners, it's a great resource.

There are numerical issues with multiplying many small numbers(imagine if you had millions of samples you had to multiply millions of small numbers for the lhd). Also taking gradients for optimization methods that require gradients is often easier when you are dealing with the log likelihood. In general, it is good to have an objective which is a sum rather than a product of variables when dealing with optimization problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, fmin is using Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm which has no convergence guarantees according to [scipy documentation][2]. This means the convergence is totally random and you should not expect to find parameters close to the originals. To get around this, I would suggest you to use a gradient based method like stochastic gradient descent or BFGS. Since you know the generative model (rvs are Gaussian distributed) you can write the likelihood and log likelihood as:&#xD;&#xA;![equations][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where a,b,c and d are your model parameters 5,2,3 and 4 respectively.&#xD;&#xA;Then take the [gradient][3] with respect to [a,b,c,d] and feed that into prime input of fmin_bfgs. Note that due to varying variance what could be solved by just linear regression is now a nastier problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, you may also want to check Generalized least squares on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity, which talk about your problem and offer several available solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfsvr.png&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin.html#scipy.optimize.fmin&#xD;&#xA;[3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient" />

It's easy to implement, and easy to reuse in very different domains. You'll find hundreds of APRIORI implementations of varying quality. And it's easy to get APRIORI wrong, actually.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;FPgrowth is much harder to implement, but also much more interesting. So from an academic point of view, everybody tries to improve FPgrowth - getting work based on APRIORI accepted will be very hard by now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a good implementation, every algorithm has it's good and it's bad situations in my opinion. A good APRIORI implementation will *only* need to scan the database *k* times to find all frequent itemsets of length *k*. In particular if your data fits into main memory this is cheap. What can kill APRIORI is too many frequent 2-itemsets (in particular when you don't use a Trie and similar acceleration techniques etc.). It works best on large data with a low number of frequent itemsets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eclat works on columns; but it needs to read each column much more often. There is some work on diffsets to reduce this work. If your data does not fit into main memory, Eclat suffers probably more than Apriori. By going depth first, it will also be able to return a first interesting result much earlier than Apriori, and you can use these results to adjust parameters; so you need less iterations to find good parameters. But by design, it cannot exploit pruning as neatly as Apriori did.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;FPGrowth compresses the data set into the tree. This works best when you have lots of duplicate records. You could probably reap of quite some gains for Apriori and Eclat too if you can presort your data and merge duplicates into weighted vectors. FPGrowth does this at an extreme level. The drawback is that the implementation is much harder; and once this tree does not fit into memory anymore it gets a mess to implement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for performance results and benchmarks - don't trust them. There are so many things to implement incorrectly. Try 10 different implementations, and you get 10 very different performance results. In particular for APRIORI, I have the impression that most implementations are broken in the sense of missing some of the main contributions of APRIORI... and of those that have these parts right, the quality of optimizations varies a lot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are actually even papers on how to implement these algorithms efficiently:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Efficient Implementations of Apriori and Eclat.&lt;br /&gt; Christian Borgelt&lt;br /&gt;Workshop of Frequent Item Set Mining Implementations (FIMI 2003, Melbourne, FL, USA).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may also want to read these surveys on this domain:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; Goethals, Bart. &quot;Survey on frequent pattern mining.&quot; Univ. of Helsinki (2003).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; Ferenc Bodon, A Survey on Frequent Itemset Mining, Technical Report, Budapest University of Technology and Economic, 2006, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* &gt; Frequent Item Set Mining&lt;br /&gt;Christian Borgelt&lt;br /&gt;Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 2(6):437-456. 2012&#xD;&#xA;" />

Classification (also known as categorization) is an example of **supervised learning**. In supervised learning you have: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * **model** - something that approximates internal structure in your data, enabling you to reason about it and make useful predictions (e.g. predict class of an object); normally model has parameters that you want to &quot;learn&quot;&#xD;&#xA; * **training** and **testing datasets** - sets of objects that you use for training your model (finding good values for parameters) and further evaluating &#xD;&#xA; * **training** and **classification algorithms** - first describes how to learn model from training dataset, second shows how to derive class of a new object given trained model&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now let's take a simple case of spam classification. Your training dataset is a corpus of emails + corresponding labels - &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not spam&quot;. Testing dataset has the same structure, but made from some independent emails (normally one just splits his dataset and makes, say, 9/10 of it to be used for training and 1/10 - for testing). One way to model emails is to represent each of them as a set (bag) of words. If we assume that words are independent of each other, we can use **Naive Bayes classifier**, that is, calculate prior probabilities for each word and each class (training algorithm) and then apply Bayes theorem to find posterior probability of a new document to belong to particular class. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, basically we have: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    raw model + training set + training algorithm -&gt; trained model&#xD;&#xA;    trained model + classification algorithm + new object -&gt; object label&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now note that we represented our objects (documents) as a bag of words. But is the only way? In fact, we can extract much more from raw text. For example, instead of words as is we can use their [stems or lemmas](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html), throw out noisy [stop words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words), add [POS tags](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml) of words, extract [named entities](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml) or even explore HTML structure of the document. In fact, more general representation of a document (and, in general, any object) is a **feature vector**. E.g. for text: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    actor, analogue, bad, burn, ..., NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ..., in_bold, ... | label&#xD;&#xA;        0,        0,   1,    1, ...,    5,    7,   2, ...,       2, ... | not spam&#xD;&#xA;        0,        1,   0,    0, ...,    3,   12,  10, ...,       0, ... | spam&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here first row is a list of possible features and subsequent rows show how many times that feature occurs in a document. E.g. in first document there's no occurrences of word &quot;actor&quot;, 1 occurrence of word &quot;burn&quot;, 5 nouns, 2 adjectives and 2 pieces of text in bold. Last column corresponds to a resulting class label. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using feature vector you can incorporate any properties of your texts. Though finding good set of features may take some time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And what about model and algorithms? Are we bound to Naive Bayes. Not at all. **logistic regression**, **SVM**, **decision trees** - just to mention few popular classifiers. (Note, that we say &quot;classifier&quot; in most cases we mean model + corresponding algorithms for training and classification). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for implementation, you can divide task into 2 parts: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Features extraction - transforming raw texts into feature vectors. &#xD;&#xA; 2. Object classification - building and applying model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First point is well worked out in many [NLP libraries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4115526/natural-language-processing).

Bishop. In a first approach I tried to implement it in C#, where I used Gauss' algorithm to solve eq. 4.99. For a single feature it gave very promising (nearly exact) results, but whenever I tried to run it with more than one feature my system matrix became singular, and the weights did not converge. I first thought that it was my implementation, but when I implemented it in SciLab the results sustained. The SciLab (more concise due to matrix operators) code I used is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    phi = [1; 0; 1; 1];&#xD;&#xA;    t = [1; 0; 0; 0];&#xD;&#xA;    w= [1];&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    w' * phi(1,:)'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    for in=1:100&#xD;&#xA;        y = [];&#xD;&#xA;        R = zeros(size(phi,1));&#xD;&#xA;        R_inv = zeros(size(phi,1));&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        for i=1:size(phi,1)&#xD;&#xA;            y(i) = 1/(1+ exp(-(w' * phi(i,:)')));&#xD;&#xA;            R(i,i) = y(i)*(1 - y(i));&#xD;&#xA;            R_inv(i,i) = 1/R(i,i);&#xD;&#xA;        end&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        z = phi * w - R_inv*(y - t)&#xD;&#xA;        w = inv(phi'*R*phi)*phi'*R*z&#xD;&#xA;    end&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With the values for phi (input/features) and t (output/classes), it yields a weight of  -0.6931472, which is pretty much 1/3, which seems fine to me, for there is 1/3 probability of beeing assigned to class 1, if feature 1 is present (please forgive me, if my terms do not comply with ML-language completely, for I am an software developer). If I now added an intercept feature, which would accord to&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    phi = [1, 1; 1, 0; 1, 1; 1, 1];&#xD;&#xA;    w = [1; 1];&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;my R-matrix becomes singular and the last weights value is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    w  =&#xD;&#xA;      - 5.8151677  &#xD;&#xA;      1.290D+30  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;which - to my reading - would mean, that the probability of belonging to class 1 would be close to 1 if feature 1 is present about 3% for the rest. There has got to be any error I made, but I do not get which one. For both implementations yield the same results I suspect that there is some point I've been missing or gotten wrong, but I do not understand which one." />

Same values receive the same rank but the presence of duplicate values affects the ranks of subsequent values (e.g., 1,2,3,3,5). Rank is a solid binning method with one major drawback, values can have different ranks in different lists.&#xD;&#xA;- `Quantiles (median, quartiles, percentiles, ...)`: Quantiles are also very useful binning methods but like Rank, one value can have different quantile if the list of values changes.&#xD;&#xA;- `Math functions`: For example, logarithmic binning is an effective method for the numerical variables with highly skewed distribution (e.g., income).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Entropy-based Binning**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Entropy based method][1] uses a split approach. The entropy (or the information content) is calculated based on the class label. Intuitively, it finds the best split so that the bins are as pure as possible that is the majority of the values in a bin correspond to have the same class label. Formally, it is characterized by finding the split with the maximal information gain. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.saedsayad.com/supervised_binning.htm" />

There's a very good overview of how to calculate Kappa and use it to evaluate a classifier in this stats.stackexchange.com answer [here][1], and a more in-depth explanation of Kappa and how to interpret it in [this paper][2], entitled &quot;Understanding Interobserver Agreement: The Kappa Statistic&quot; by Viera &amp; Garrett (2005).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The benefit of using Kappa, particularly in an unbalanced data set like yours, is that with a 90-10% imbalance between the classes, you can achieve 90% accuracy by simply labeling all of the data points with the label of the more commonly occurring class. The Kappa statistic is describing how well the classifier performs above that baseline level of performance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kappa ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no agreement between the raters, 1 indicating a perfect agreement, and negative numbers indicating systematic disagreement. While interpretation is somewhat arbitrary (and very task-dependent), Landis &amp; Koch (1977) defined the following interpretation system which can work as a general rule of thumb:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Kappa Agreement&#xD;&#xA;    &lt; 0 Less than chance agreement&#xD;&#xA;    0.01–0.20 Slight agreement&#xD;&#xA;    0.21– 0.40 Fair agreement&#xD;&#xA;    0.41–0.60 Moderate agreement&#xD;&#xA;    0.61–0.80 Substantial agreement&#xD;&#xA;    0.81–0.99 Almost perfect agreement&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which would indicate that your algorithm is performing moderately well.

If you already have probabilities from separate classifiers, you can simply use them as weights and compute weighted average. For more sophisticated cases there are Bayesian combiners (each classifier has its prior), boosting algorithms (e.g. see [AdaBoost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost)) and others. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note, that ensembles where initially created for combining different learners, not different sets if features.

A couple papers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[&quot;Prediction of protein-protein interactions using one-class classification methods and integrating diverse biological data&quot;][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[&quot;A One-Class Classification Approach for Protein Sequences and Structures&quot;][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the very least I would try some one-class methods and compare the performance using validation with your binary/multi-class classification approaches.  There are also open source implementations for many of these so it shouldn't be too costly to try them out, for example LibSVM has a one-class SVM implementation.  Additionally, it might prove valuable for use in an ensemble with binary classifiers, since there may be more disagreement in their predictions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Higher level representation embedding / clustering**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Along the lines of what you were thinking with (1) and the other post suggesting PCA, approaches like clustering, sparse coding, or even topic modeling - treating each protein as a document string and different protein families as different topics - could yield a representation that might make classifying the proteins straightforward.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I.e., you could identify which group/cluster a protein belongs to or classify the cluster memberships / embedded representations.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;E.g., such embedding approaches as sparse coding can yield representations that reveal which cluster a protein belongs too - so that some sets of features are only active (non-zero) for proteins in the same cluster - which can make classifying them much easier. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally class labels or known cluster membership can be incorporated in the embedding process for most methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ensemble**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ensembles of multiple classifiers tend to work best - especially when the classifiers are very diverse and can achieve comparable performance individually.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are at least two ways use ensembles for this problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. You can build an ensemble of binary classifiers by sampling multiple different same-size negative sets and training a classifier on each.&#xD;&#xA; 2. You can build an ensemble from different approaches, such as binary classifiers with different negative samples, combined with a one-class classification approach, combined with classification models trained on the embedded data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://journal.imbio.de/articles/pdf/jib-77.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~busarobi/PDFs/BaBuKe09.pdf" />

I am capturing the date, my time of departure, my time of arrival, the route I took (there are two or three possible ones), weather conditions (wet/dry and clear/hazy/foggy), and whether I stopped (and if so, for what reason - fuel/toilet break/food break, and for how long) for every journey to and from work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to create a system to analyse this data and suggest an optimal departure time (for the next journey) based on day of the week, weather conditions, and whether i need to stop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anecdotally, I can see that Tuesday mornings are worse than other mornings, the earlier I leave the more likely I am to take a toilet break or a food break, and obviously that the journey takes longer on rainy or foggy days than on clear and dry days - but I would like the system to empirically tell me that!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I assume this is a machine-learning and statistical analysis problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I have absolutely no knowledge of machine-learning, or statistical methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What statistical methods should I use to do this kind of analysis to the point where the data will lead to suggestions like &quot;tomorrow is Tuesday and it is going to rain, so you must leave home between 7.50 and 8.00, and take route XYZ, to get the optimal driving time. Oh and chances are you will need a toilet break - and I have factored that in&quot;? (assume that I manually enter tomorrow’s weather forecast - I’ll look into integrating with a weather service later)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that this is life-hacking for me, trying to optimise the hell out of a tedious process, and it is very personal - specific to me and my habits, specific to this route, and specific to the morning/evening commute times. Google Maps with Traffic, TomTom with IQ, and Waze do very well in the more open-ended situations of ad-hoc driving-time prediction. Even Apple is happy to tell me on my iPhone notification screen how long it will take me to get home if I leave right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note, it appears to me that traffic is not a consideration - that is to say, I do not think I need to know the actual traffic conditions - traffic is a function of day of the week and weather. For example, there are more people on the roads on Monday and Tuesday mornings, and people drive more slowly, and more people are in cars (opting to drive instead of cycle or take public transport) when it rains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To what extent can I let the data do all the talking? I have a somewhat ambiguous hidden agenda which may not be apparent from the data;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- I should be at work at 9.30 (i.,e. 9.15 +/- 15 minutes) every day, but the occasional 10am arrival is OK&#xD;&#xA;- I want to leave home as late as possible, and yet arrive at work as early as possible&#xD;&#xA;- I want to leave work as early as possible, and yet have done at least 8 hours’ work&#xD;&#xA;- it is OK for me to, say, leave half an hour early on one day but stay late on another to compensate&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think I can come up with a procedural formula that can encompass all of these rules, but my gut feeling is that statistical analysis can make it a lot smarter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from the methods of analysis, the technology stack is not an issue. Java is my language of choice - I am quite familiar with programming in it, and in creating web applications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that it is possible, are there Java libraries that can provide the requisite methods?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What limitations are there? I want to keep capturing more and more data every day, making the data set bigger, hopefully, making the prediction more accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What other ways are there to do it? Can I push this data into, say, Wolfram Programming Cloud, or maybe something Google provides to get the desired results?" />

Absent any data, I'd assume there isn't much variance over the working week, but that's one thing the data will quickly confirm or refute. If it is varying, you can use a different model for each day. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have two variables; the departure times from home and work, respectively. Let's call them t_h and t_w. Let's call the commute time T_c(t), where t is the time of day. You can estimate this function from the data, so I'll assume it is given.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You want to maximize c t_h - (1-c) t_w subject to the constraints t_h + T_c(t_h) &lt; 9.5 and t_w &gt; t_h + T_c(t_h) + 8&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where c is a constant you can set to adjust the relative importance of leaving home early relative to leaving work early. You should be able to solve this numerical optimization problem with Mathematica, MATLAB, or something similar. I would not recommend Java; it's not meant for this. The only tricky part is estimating T_c. You know that it's a non-negative function, so you could use the standard trick of estimating it's logarithm (say, with kernels) and exponentiating. For implementation with Mathematica see [Smoothing Data, Filling Missing Data, and Nonparametric Fitting](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/InterpolatingFunction.html) and [Constrained Optimization](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/ConstrainedOptimizationOverview.html)." />

First of all, it's worth to **visualize** your data. I will pretend I have following data: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![number of words vs. age][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here we see slight dependency between age and number of words in responses. We may assume that young people (approx. between 12 and 25) tend to use 1-4 words, while people of age 25-35 try to give longer answers. But how do we split these points? I would do it something like this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In 2D plot it looks pretty straightforward, and this is how it works most of the time in practise. However, you asked for splitting data by a single variable - age. That is, something like this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it a good split? I don't know. In fact, it depends on your actual needs and interpretation of the &quot;cut points&quot;. That's why I asked about *concrete* task. Anyway, this interpretation is up to you. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practise, you will have much more text-based variables. E.g. you can use every word as a feature (don't forget to [stem or lemmatize](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html) it first) with values from zero to a number of occurrences in the response. Visualizing high-dimensional data is not an easy task, so you need a way to discover groups of data without plotting them. [**Clustering**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) is a general approach for this. Though clustering algorithms may work with data of arbitrary dimensionality, we still have only 2D to plot it, so let's come back to our example. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With algorithm like [**k-means**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) you can obtain 2 groups like this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two dots - red and blue - show cluster centres, calculated by k-means. You can use coordinates of these points to split your data by any subset of axes, even if you have 10k dimensions.

Typically problem with memory comes from only one of these two numbers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Too many observations (n &gt;&gt; m)&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you have **too many observations**, but number of variables is from small to moderate, you can **build covariance matrix incrementally**. Indeed, typical PCA consists of constructing covariance matrix of size *m* x *m* and applying singular value decomposition to it. With *m*=1000 variables of type float64 covariance matrix has size 1000*1000*8 ~ 8Mb, which easily fits into memory and may be used with SVD. So you need only to build covariance matrix without loading entire dataset into memory - [pretty tractable task](http://rebcabin.github.io/blog/2013/01/22/covariance-matrices/). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively, you can select small representative sample from your dataset and **approximate covariance matrix**.

E.g. if you work with 640x480 images, every observation has 640*480=307200 variables, which results in 703Gb covariance matrix! That's definitely not what you would like to keep in memory of your computer. Or even in memory of your cluster. So we need to reduce dimensions without building covariance matrix at all. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My favourite method for doing it is [**Random Projection**](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/Ping/KDD06_rp.pdf). In short, if you have dataset *X* of size *n* x *m*, you can multiply it by some sparse random matrix *R* of size *m* x *k* (with *k* &lt;&lt; *m*) and obtain new matrix *X'* of a much smaller size *n* x *k* with *approximately same properties* as original one. Why it works? Well, you should know that PCA aims to find set of orthogonal axes (principal components) and project your data onto first *k* of them. It turns out, that sparse random vectors are *nearly orthogonal* and thus may also be used as a new basis. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, of course, you don't have to multiply the whole dataset *X* by *R* - you can translate every observation *x* into new basis separately or in mini-batches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's also somewhat similar algorithm called **Random SVD**.

Therefore weightings of the form $\sum_i w_i e_i$ are equivalent to duplicating the data w_i times (eg for w_i integer). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One simple case is if you have repeated data - rather than keeping all the duplicated data points, you just &quot;weight&quot; your one repeated sample by the number of instances.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now whilst this is easy to do in a batch setting, it is hard in vowpal wabbits online big data setting: given that you have a large data set, you do not just want to represent the data n times to deal with the weighting ( because it increases your computational load). Similarly, just multiplying the gradient vector by the weighting - which is correct in batch gradient descent - will cause big problems for stochastic/online gradient descent: essentially you shoot off in one direction ( think of large integer weights) then you shoot off in the other - causing significant instability. SGD essentially relies on all the errors to be of roughly the same order ( so that the learning rate can be set appropriately). So what they propose is to ensure that the update for training sample x_i with weight n is equivalent to presenting training sample x_i n times consecutively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The idea being that presenting it consecutively reduces the problem because the error gradient (for that single example $x_i$) reduces for each consecutive presentation and update (as you get closer &amp; closer to the minimum for that specific example). In other words the consecutive updates provides a kind of feedback control. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me it sounds like you would still have instabilities (you get to zero error on x_i, then you get to zero error on x_i+1,...). the learning rate will need to be adjusted to take into account the size of the weights.&#xD;&#xA;" />

The goal of the paramedic is to get released from the hospital as soon as possible. I am curious, what are the factors in how long an ambulance off loads a patient at the hospital? Can I predict how long an offload will take given certain variables. And how confident can I be in this model? The Dependent Variable is HospitalTime, it is a ratio type of data and is measured in seconds. The Independent Variables are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Hospital, a nominal type of data recoded into integers, 1 would stand&#xD;&#xA;   for Lee Memorial.&#xD;&#xA; - Ambulance, a nominal type of data recoded into integers, 9 would&#xD;&#xA;   stand for ambulance #9&#xD;&#xA; - PatientPriority is an ordinal type of data recoded into integers.

Items that weren't very similar were being bucketed together in one dimension, while there were available dimensions that weren't used. The results weren't completely random, but they were definitely worse than the output from the hierarchical clustering. I attempted the SVD step with Mahaut and Octave and the results were similar. For the hierarchical clustering I used the Jaccard measure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point I am starting to doubt the notion of SVD as a way to reduce dimensionality. Do you think that SVD cannot be used effectively in this case (and why?) or do you think that I made some mistake along the way?" />

But the main problem (at least from your point of view) is that as the feature becomes more complex (like n-gram) the feature count increases dramatically. This is manageable. Basically before classification you must score your features and then threshold at a certain score. this way the features (or in your case n-grams) that are scored below a certain level are omitted and the feature count becomes manageable.&#xD;&#xA;as for the scoring. There are numerous ways (which to select is dependent on your application) to score the features.

I have some questions on this topic. I m new in the field of deep learning and I did some tutorials but I cant relate or distinguish concepts from eachother. Hence I formulated some questions and I hope that some specialist of this community can answer them and help me to understand whats deep learning really is. Neural networks? special methods? word vector representation? Information extraction? I need a clear picture of the field. THanks a lot in advance, here are my questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;a) Why is there a lot of interest in the NLP and ML community for deep learning architectures? What are deep learning architectures? *I think Multi-Layer Neural (Tensor) Networks, so called deep networks, like Socher use it?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;b) Why do NLP and ML community need approaches to learn complex non-linear relationships? *What's an good example of compley nonlinear relationships? I think Single-Layer Neural networks can only distinguish linear input data according to their activation function. And because they have input data that can't easily separateby a straight line. they need deep networks with ML for processing complex data. Maybe they need them because they using multi dimensional word vector spaces?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;c) What are deep learning methods: for example backpropagation or is it a neural tensor network or is it the word vector representation? *I cant distinguish what are deep learning architectures and methods? Or are the the same?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;e) And how can I relate deep learning to open information extraction? And what are good examples for the application of deep learning methods for open information extraction? *My approach is, that open information extraction is extraction of knowlegede on any domain with any relations from unstructured data (like webpages) with the target to aquiring knowlege. If you do this for a specific domain you have to optimize your NLP tools manually to this domain and relations, but in other domain that doesnt work well. Therefore &quot;deep learning&quot;(clearer: deep neural networks, recursive or tensor NN) architectures are interessting, because they unsupervised learn to extract knowlegde and need no manually optimizating relating to a topic.* &#xD;&#xA;*A method are word vectors for representing words and not specific programmed model. The &quot;deep learning&quot; in the NLP field is, that the NN learn the before manual models automatically and mapping the words in a vector space. An exmaple is Socher's Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality, where deep learning is used to extract the positive or negative statement of a sentance.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Is this approach true or i m on a false way?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For any comments i m very thankful.

The goal of the paramedic is to get released from the hospital as soon as possible. I am curious, what are the factors in how long an ambulance off loads a patient at the hospital? Can I predict how long an offload will take given certain variables. And how confident can I be in this model? The Dependent Variable is HospitalTime, it is a ratio type of data and is measured in seconds. The Independent Variables are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Hospital, a nominal type of data recoded into integers, 1 would stand&#xD;&#xA;   for Lee Memorial.&#xD;&#xA; - Ambulance, a nominal type of data recoded into integers, 9 would&#xD;&#xA;   stand for ambulance #9&#xD;&#xA; - PatientPriority is an ordinal type of data recoded into integers. A 1&#xD;&#xA;   is a high priority, 2 is a medium priority and 3 is low acuity.&#xD;&#xA; - MonthOfCall is an interval type of data recoded into integers. A 6&#xD;&#xA;   would be June and 12 is December. A 12 (December) is not twice as&#xD;&#xA;   much as a 6 (June) in this case.&#xD;&#xA; - HourOfCall is an interval type of data recoded into integers. Once&#xD;&#xA;   again, an offload happening at 10:00 pm is not more than something&#xD;&#xA;   happening at 10:00 am.&#xD;&#xA; - Officer1 and Officer2 are nominal data and are integers representing&#xD;&#xA;   an EMT and a paramedic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My question is this: Given this type of data and my goal to predict the off loading time at the hospital, what kind of regression model should I look into?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have looked at my statistics books from university days and they are all using ratio data.

For predicting continuous variables there's nothing more basic than **simple linear regression**. &quot;Simple&quot; in the name means that there's only one predictor variable used (+ intercept, of course): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    y = b0 + x*b1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where `b0` is an intercept and `b1` is a slope. For example, you may want to predict lemonade consumption in a park based on temperature:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    cons = b0 + temp * b1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Temperature is in well-defined **continuous** variable. But if we talk about something more abstract like &quot;weather&quot;, then it's harder to understand how we measure and encode it. It's ok if we say that the weather takes values `{terrible, bad, normal, good, excellent}` and assign values numbers from -2 to +2 (implying that &quot;excellent&quot; weather is twice as good as &quot;good&quot;). But what if the weather is given by words `{shiny, rainy, cool, ...}`? We can't give an order to these variables. We call such variables **categorical**. Since there's no natural order between different categories, we can't encode them as a single numerical variable (and linear regression expects numbers only), but we can use so-called **dummy encoding**:  instead of a single variable `weather` we use 3 variables - `[weather_shiny, weather_rainy, weather_cool]`, only one of which can take value 1, and others should take value 0. In fact, we will have to drop one variable because of [collinearity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity). So model for predicting traffic from weather may look like this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    traffic = b0 + weather_shiny * b1 + weather_rainy * b2  # weather_cool dropped&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where either `b1` or `b2` is 1, or both are 0. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that you can also encounter non-linear dependency between predictor and predicted variables (you can easily check it by plotting `(x,y)` pairs). Simplest way to deal with it without refusing linear model is to use polynomial features - simply add polynomials of your feature as new features. E.g. for temperature example (for dummy variables it doesn't make sense, cause `1^n` and `0^n` are still 1 and 0 for any `n`):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    traffic = b0 + temp * b1 + temp^2 * b2 [+ temp^3 * b3 + ...]" />

Men in their 20s are unlikely to purchase menopause supplements, and women in their 50s are also unlikely to buy creatine.

Categorizing buyers also helps with this problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may want to read up on shopping cart analysis, which is not a new problem.

This rules out a conventional RDBMS, and demands new techniques for processing; in particular, various Hadoop-like frameworks make it easy to distribute a computation over a cluster, at the cost of restricting the form of this computation. I'll second the reference to http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html ; Big Data techniques are a last resort for datasets which are simply too big to handle any other way. I'd say any dataset for any purpose could qualify if it was big enough - though if the shape of the problem is such that existing &quot;big data&quot; tools aren't appropriate, then it would probably be better to come up with a new name.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course there is some overlap; when I (briefly) worked at last.fm, we worked on the same 50TB dataset using Hadoop and also in an SQL database on a fairly ridiculous server (I remember it had 1TB RAM, and this is a few years ago). Which in a sense meant it both was and wasn't big data, depending on which job you were working on.

I'm new in the field of deep learning, and while I did some tutorials, I can't relate or distinguish concepts from one another. I hope that some specialist of this community can answer a few questions and help me to understand whats deep learning really is. Neural networks? Special methods? Word vector representation? Information extraction? I need a clear picture of the field. Thanks a lot in advance, here are my questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;a) Why is there a lot of interest in the NLP and ML communities for deep learning architectures? What are deep learning architectures? *I think Multi-Layer Neural (Tensor) Networks, so called deep networks, like Socher uses it?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;b) Why do the NLP and ML communities need approaches to learn complex non-linear relationships? *What's a good example of complex nonlinear relationships? I think Single-Layer Neural networks can only distinguish linear input data according to their activation function, and because they have input data that can't easily be separated with a straight line. Deep networks with ML are needed for processing complex data. Maybe they need them because they are using multi-dimensional word vector spaces?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;c) What are deep learning methods: for example back-propagation, or is it a neural tensor network, or is it the word vector representation? *I can't distinguish what are deep learning architectures and methods? Or are they the same?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;e) And how can I relate deep learning to open information extraction? And what are good examples for the application of deep learning methods for open information extraction? *My approach is, that open information extraction is extraction of knowlegede on any domain with any relations from unstructured data (like webpages) with the target to aquiring knowledge. If you do this for a specific domain, you have to optimize your NLP tools manually to this domain and relations, but in other domain that doesn't work well. Therefore &quot;deep learning&quot;(clearer: deep neural networks, recursive or tensor NN) architectures are interessting, because they use unsupervised learn to extract knowlegde and need no manual optimization relating to a topic.* &#xD;&#xA;*A method are word vectors for representing words and not specific programmed model. The &quot;deep learning&quot; in the NLP field is, that the NN learn the before manual models automatically and mapping the words in a vector space. An exmaple is Socher's Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality, where deep learning is used to extract the positive or negative statement of a sentence.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Is this approach true, or am I looking at this wrong?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would be grateful for any comments. Thanks in advance!&#xD;&#xA;" />

" Text="I am trying to find a formula, method, or model to use to analyze the likelihood that a specific event influenced some longitudinal data. I am having difficultly figuring out what to search for on Google.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is an example scenario:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Image you own a business that has an average of 100 walk-in customers every day. One day, you decide you want to increase the number of walk-in customers arriving at your store each day, so you pull a crazy stunt outside your store to get attention. Over the next week, you see on average 125 customers a day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over the next few months, you again decide that you want to get some more business, and perhaps sustain it a bit longer, so you try some other random things to get more customers in your store. Unfortunately, you are not the best marketer, and some of your tactics have little or no effect, and others even have a negative impact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What methodology could I use to determine the probability that any one individual event positively or negatively impacted the number of walk-in customers? I am fully aware that correlation does not necessarily equal causation, but what methods could I use to determine the likely increase or decrease in your business's daily walk in client's following a specific event?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not interested in analyzing whether or not there is a correlation between your attempts to increase the number of walk-in customers, but rather whether or not any one single event, independent of all others, was impactful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize that this example is rather contrived and simplistic, so I will also give you a brief description of the actual data that I am using:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am attempting to determine the impact that a particular marketing agency has on their client's website when they publish new content, perform social media campaigns, etc. For any one specific agency, they may have anywhere from 1 to 500 clients. Each client has websites ranging in size from 5 pages to well over 1 million. Over the course of the past 5 year, each agency has annotated all of their work for each client, including the type of work that was done, the number of webpages on a website that were influenced, the number of hours spent, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the above data, which I have assembled into a data warehouse (placed into a bunch of star/snowflake schemas), I need to determine how likely it was that any one piece of work (any one event in time) had an impact on the traffic hitting any/all pages influenced by a specific piece of work. I have created models for 40 different types of content that are found on a website that describes the typical traffic pattern a page with said content type might experience from launch date until present. Normalized relative to the appropriate model, I need to determine the highest and lowest number of increased or decreased visitors a specific page received as the result of a specific piece of work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I have experience with basic data analysis (linear and multiple regression, correlation, etc), I am at a loss for how to approach solving this problem. Whereas in the past I have typically analyzed data with multiple measurements for a given axis (for example temperature vs thirst vs animal and determined the impact on thirst that increased temperate has across animals), I feel that above, I am attempting to analyze the impact of a single event at some point in time for a non-linear, but predictable (or at least model-able), longitudinal dataset. I am stumped :(&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any help, tips, pointers, recommendations, or directions would be extremely helpful and I would be eternally grateful!&#xD;&#xA;" />

Convince management the the change will be for the better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Even if management agrees, they'll still want to know why variances have occurred, and hence you'll need to be able to supply more data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Although exception reporting is best, management will want to see everything anyway, as doing so makes them feel as though they are doing something useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Don't change everything at once- too big a change at once can cause resistance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5.

If you are analyzing *height* of people, you could use *course-grained variables* that have only a few possible values -- e.g. &quot;above-average, average, below-average&quot; -- or a *fine-grained variable*, with many or an infinite number of values -- e.g. integer values or real number values.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A measure is &quot;**fuzzy**&quot; if the distinction between alternative values is not crisp.  In the course-grained variable for *height*, a &quot;crisp&quot; measure would mean that any given individual could *only* be assigned one value -- e.g. a tall-ish person is either &quot;above-average&quot;, or &quot;average&quot;.  In contrast, a &quot;fuzzy&quot; measure allows for *degrees of membership* for each value, with &quot;membership&quot; taking values from 0 to 1.0.  Thus, a tall-ish person could be a value of &quot;0.5 above-average&quot;, &quot;0.5 average&quot;, &quot;0.0 below-average&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, a measure is &quot;**rough**&quot; when two values are given: upper and lower bounds as an estimate of the &quot;crisp&quot; measure.  In our example of a tall-ish person, the rough measure would be {UPPER = above-average, LOWER = average}.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why use granular, fuzzy, or rough measures at all, you might ask?  Why not measure everything in nice, precise real numbers?  Because many real-world phenomena don't have a good, reliable intrinsic measure and measurement procedure that results in a real number.  If you ask married couples to rate the quality of their marriage on a scale from 1 to 10, or 1.00 to 10.00, they might give you a number (or range of numbers), but how reliable are those reports? Using a course-grained measure (e.g. &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;neutral/mixed&quot;, &quot;unhappy&quot;), or fuzzy measure, or rough measure can be more reliable and more credible in your analysis.  Generally, it's much better to use rough/crude measures well than to use precise/fine-grained measures poorly." />

Dimensionality Reduction: There are lots of problems where PCA (a special case of an SVD) followed by a simple Machine Learning method applied on the reduced dataset produces much better results than a non parametric model on the full (non-reduced dataset). For an example see [Bhat and Zaelit, 2012][1] where PCA followed by linear regression performs better than more involved non-parametric models. It also suggests reasons why dimensionality reduction performs better in these cases.  &#xD;&#xA; 2. Visualizing data: Higher dimensional data is complicated to visualize and one often needs to be able to reduce the dimension of the dataset to view it. This comes very handy when one has to &quot;view&quot; the results of clustering on a higher dimensional dataset.  &#xD;&#xA; 3. Numerical Accuracy: Eigenvalues are generally handy in order to understand condition numbers of matrices and hence be able to figure out if results of Linear regression or other methods that require to solve Ax=b would be numerically accurate. Positive Definiteness of a matrix might also be able to guarantee bounds on numerical accuracies. &#xD;&#xA; 4. Recommendations: Some methods like collaborative filtering use matrix factorization (SVD) tuned smartly to solve recommendation problems.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Regularization: Regularization is commonly used to reduce over-fitting in machine learning problems.

Sometimes, its importance relies on the fact that it allows you to carry on with what you are doing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, you usually need column independence (independent variables between predictors) because multiple regression will behave badly with highly correlated variables. Even worst, when some of your columns (or rows) are dependent, your matrix is not invertible. Why? Because matrix inversion A^-1 involves the determinant 1/|A|, which is 0 when columns or rows are linearly dependent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eigenvalues is a common occurrence in calculations related to maximization/minimization in machine learning. Let's say you are interested in principal component analysis. A very important idea there is dimensional reduction (you have a dataset with many variables and want to reduce the number of variables without losing too much explanatory power.) One solution is to project your data onto a lower dimensional space (e.g. taking your data with 50 variables and reducing them to 5 variables.) Turns out a good projection to use is one that includes as much variation as possible and maximization of this variation results in the eigenvalue equation S u  = λ u. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other cases, you explicitly include the eigenvalue equation of some quantity of interest because in doing so, you're changing the coordinate system in which you represent the variables. Take the case of a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution in which the argument of the exponent is given by Δ = (x-μ)^T Σ (x-μ). If you consider the eigenvalue equation of Σ, the exponent can be written as Δ = y_1^2 / λ_1 + y_2^2 / λ_2 (in two dimensions) This is the equation of an ellipse only if λ_1 and λ_2 are positive. Therefore, you obtain the following graphical interpretation (Bishop, PRML, p.81):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Positive semi-definite matrices are used as a matter of convenience. They are well-behaved and well-understood. For instance, their eigenvalues are non-negative, and if you remember the previous paragraph, the argument Δ required positive eigenvalues. By now, you can see why some concepts are very popular: You need them for your calculations or they need each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can recommend a couple of books:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. [Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Modern-Introduction-CD-ROM/dp/0534998453/ref=ed_oe_h) by David Poole &#xD;&#xA;2. [Understanding Complex Datasets: Data Mining with Matrix Decompositions ](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Complex-Datasets-Decompositions-Knowledge/dp/1584888326) by David Skillicorn. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second recommendation is more specialized and requires a decent understanding of the basics, but it is of great help to understand matrix decompositions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/pNrLb.png" />

So you would want to encode two time variables:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- `day_of_week`&#xD;&#xA;- `absolute_time`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## In general &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several common time frames that trends occur over:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- `absolute_time`&#xD;&#xA;- `day_of_year`&#xD;&#xA;- `day_of_week`&#xD;&#xA;- `month_of_year`&#xD;&#xA;- `hour_of_day`&#xD;&#xA;- `minute_of_hour`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look for trends in all of these.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Weird trends &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look for weird trends too.  For example you may see rare but persistent time based trends:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- `is_easter`&#xD;&#xA;- `is_superbowl`&#xD;&#xA;- `is_national_emergency`&#xD;&#xA;- `etc.`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These often require that you cross reference your data against some external source that maps events to time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why graph?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two reasons that I think graphing is so important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *Weird trends*  &#xD;&#xA;   While the general trends can be automated pretty easily (just add them&#xD;&#xA;   every time), weird trends will often require a human eye and knowledge&#xD;&#xA;   of the world to find.  This is one reason that graphing is so&#xD;&#xA;   important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *Data errors*  &#xD;&#xA;   All too often data has serious errors in it.  For example, you may find that the dates were encoded in two formats and only one of them has been correctly loaded into your program.  There are a myriad of such problems and they are surprisingly common.  This is the other reason I think graphing is important, not just for time series, but for any data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/QGYUC.png" />

My hunch is that you could formulate your task as a binary one where you train and test one classifier for each class you want to predict, and simply set up the data matrix so that there are two classes to predict - (1) the one you're interested in classifying and (2) everything else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In that case, instead of your training set looking like this (where each row is a document and columns 1-3 contain features for that document, and the class column is the class to be predicted): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    1           2           3           class&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    law&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    president&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;it would look like the following in the case where you're interested in detecting the politics class against everything else:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    1           2           3           class&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    non-politics&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    non-politics&#xD;&#xA;    feature1    feature2    feature3    politics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You would need to do this process for each class you're interested in predicting, and then train and test one classifier per class and evaluate each classifier according to your chosen metrics (usually accuracy, precision, or recall or some variation thereof).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as choosing features, this requires quite a bit of thinking. Features can be highly dependent on the type of text you're trying to classify, so be sure to explore your dataset and get a sense for how people are writing in each domain. Qualitative investigation isn't enough to decide once and for all what are good features, but it is a good way to get ideas. Also, look into [TF-IDF][1] weighting of terms instead of just using their frequency within each instance of your dataset. This will help you pick up on (a) terms that are prevalent within a document (and possibly a target class) and (b) terms that distinguish a given document from other documents. I hope this helps a little.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf" />

So you would want to encode two time variables:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- `day_of_week`&#xD;&#xA;- `absolute_time`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## In general &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several common time frames that trends occur over:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- `absolute_time`&#xD;&#xA;- `day_of_year`&#xD;&#xA;- `day_of_week`&#xD;&#xA;- `month_of_year`&#xD;&#xA;- `hour_of_day`&#xD;&#xA;- `minute_of_hour`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look for trends in all of these.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Weird trends &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look for weird trends too.

For example, you may find that the dates were encoded in two formats and only one of them has been correctly loaded into your program.  There are a myriad of such problems and they are surprisingly common.

Tokenization: Splitting a sentence into individual words&#xD;&#xA; 3. Lemmatization: Converting a word to its root form. E.g. says, said,&#xD;&#xA;    saying will all map to root form - say &#xD;&#xA; 4. Stemmer: It is similar to a&#xD;&#xA;    lemmatizer, but it stems a word rather than get to the root form.&#xD;&#xA;    e.g. laughed, laughing will stem to laugh. However, said, saying&#xD;&#xA;    will map to sa - which is not particularly enlightening in terms of&#xD;&#xA;    what &quot;sa&quot; means&#xD;&#xA; 5. POS tagger: Tags a word with the Part of Speech - what is a noun, verb, preposition etc.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Parser: Links words with POS tags to other words with POS tags. E.g. John ate an apple. Here John and apple are nouns linked by the verb - eat. John is the subject of the verb, and apple is the object of the verb.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are looking for the state of the art for these tools, check out [StanfordCoreNLP][1], which has most of these tools and a trained model to identify the above from a document.

Here are a few of them: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Machine Translation: Automatic Translation from one language to another&#xD;&#xA; 2. Information Retrieval: Something like a search engine, that retrieves relevant information from a large set of documents based on a search query&#xD;&#xA; 3. Information Extraction: Extract concepts and keywords - such as names of people, locations, times, synonyms etc.&#xD;&#xA; 4.

However there are a few considerations you should take into account: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. In your first sentence, Obama in incorrectly classified as an organization, instead of a person. This is because the training model used my NLTK probably does not have enough data to recognize Obama as a PERSON. So, one way would be to update this model by training a new model with a lot of labeled training data. Generating labeled training data is one of the most expensive tasks in NLP - because of all the man hours it takes to tag sentences with the correct Part of Speech as well as semantic role. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. In sentence 2, there are 2 concepts - &quot;Former Vice President&quot;, and &quot;Dick Cheney&quot;. You can use co-reference to identify the relation between the 2 NNPs. Both the NNP are refering to the same entity, and the same entity could be referenced as - &quot;former vice president&quot; as well as &quot;Dick Cheney&quot;. Co-reference is often used to identify the Named entity that pronouns refer to. e.g. &quot;Dick Cheney is the former vice president of USA. He is a Republican&quot;. Here the pronoun &quot;he&quot; refers to &quot;Dick Cheney&quot;, and it should be identified by a co-reference identification tool. " />

However, since I am dealing with 32768 bits at different locations, it is quite hard to visualize if there is some kind of dependency. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As every bit at location ``x``can be regarded as one dimension of an observation I thought to use PCA to reduce the number of dimensions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, for every of the 5 devices:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. I randomly sample ``n`` measurements at point ``t1``and ``t2`` seperatly&#xD;&#xA; 2. I prepare an array as input for ``pca()`` with ``m``*n columns (``m``&lt; 32768; its a subset of all the observed bits, as the original data might be too big for pca) and 4 rows (one row for each device).&#xD;&#xA; 3. On this array ``A`` I calculate the pca: ``[coeff score latent] = pca(zscore(A))```&#xD;&#xA; 4. Then I try to visualize it using ``biplot``: ``biplot(coeff(:,1:2), 'score', score(:,1:2))``&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this gives me really strange results. Maybe PCA is not the right approach for this problem? I also modified the input data to do the PCA not on the logical bit array itself. Instead, I created a vector, which holds the indices where there is a '1' in the original measurement array. Also this produces strange results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I am completely new to PCA I want to ask you if you either see a flaw in the process or if PCA is just not the right approach for my goal and I better look for other dimension reduction approaches or clustering algorithms." />

Assuming one user profiles takes 10Kb of storage, you need only ~9.5Gb for every million of users, which is pretty little and gives you all advantages of mature relational databases. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It makes sense to use **HBase** only when you have really many users (say, &gt; 1B) or when data is very sparse (most columns are empty). But don't expect it to be as convenient as good old SQL databases. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In advertising, and especially in [real-time bidding][1], very fast retrieval of user profiles is needed. [**Aerospike**][2] becomes more and more popular for this task.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Analysing data slices&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Common use of business logs is to analyse specific slices of data, e.g. number of users from France that visited sites from &quot;game&quot; category on November 1-14, 2014. Standard way to manage such data efficiently is to organize them into [**data cubes**][3]. You won't get individual records (e.g. users), but you'll get aggregated statistics really fast. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such cubes may have many different dimensions, but in 99% of cases they have **date field** that they are **partitioned** by. It makes great sense, because almost every query includes time period to get data from. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for software, **Vertica** is great for such aggregations. Cheaper* solution from Hadoop world is **Impala**, which is also great. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(* - if you count only license price)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Machine learning&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It really depends on concrete tasks and ML toolkit in use. For real-time bidding you would want blazing fast access to user profile vectors and would probably prefer Aerospike. For online learning **Spark Streaming** may be used as a data source, and no storage used at all. For offline machine learning there's excellent [**MLlib**][4] from the same Spark project, which works with a variety of sources. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://www.aerospike.com/&#xD;&#xA;[3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cube&#xD;&#xA;[4]: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html" />

Big Data is often characterized by the 3 V's: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - volume, &#xD;&#xA; - velocity, and &#xD;&#xA; - variety. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More V's than these 3 have been invented since. I suppose the V's were a catchy way to characterize what is Big Data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But as hinted, computational intensity is a perfect reason for using Hadoop (if your algorithm is computationally expensive). And, as hinted, the problem you describe is perfect for Hadoop, especially since it is embarrassingly parallel in nature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is Hadoop a good choice for you? I would argue, yes. Why? Because &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Hadoop is open source (compared with proprietary systems which may be expensive and black boxes), &#xD;&#xA; 2. your problem lends itself well to the MapReduce paradigm (embarassingly parallel, shared-nothing), &#xD;&#xA; 3. Hadoop is easily scalable with commodity hardware (as opposed to specialized hardware, and you should get linear speed-up in your performance with just throwing hardware at the problem, and you can just spin a cluster as needed on cloud service providers),&#xD;&#xA; 4. Hadoop allows multiple client languages (Java is only one of many supported languages),&#xD;&#xA; 5. there might be a library available already to do your cross-product operation, and&#xD;&#xA; 6. you're shipping compute code, not data, around the network (which you should benefit from, and as opposed to other distributed platforms where you are shipping data to compute nodes which is the bottleneck).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please note, Hadoop is not a distributed file system (as mentioned, and corrected already). Hadoop is distributed storage and processing platform. The distributed storage component of Hadoop is called the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and the distributed processing component is called MapReduce. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hadoop has now evolved slightly. They keep the HDFS part for distributed storage. But they have a new component called YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which serves to appropriate resources (CPU, RAM) for any compute task (including MapReduce). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the &quot;overhead&quot; part, there is noticeable overhead with starting/stopping a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) per tasks (map tasks, reduce tasks). You can specify for your MapReduce Jobs to reuse JVMs to mitigate this issue. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If &quot;overhead&quot; is really an issue, look into Apache Spark, which is part of the Hadoop ecosystem, and they are orders of magnitude faster than MapReduce, especially for iterative algorithms. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have used Hadoop to compute pairwise comparisons (e.g. correlation matrix, similarity matrix) that are O(N^2) (n choose 2) in worst case running time complexity. Imagine computing the correlations between 16,000 variables (16,000 choose 2); Hadoop can easily process and store the results if you have the commodity resources to support the cluster. I did this using the preeminent cloud service provider (I won't name it, but you can surely guess who it is), and it cost me &lt; $100 and under 18 hours.  " />

Since the size of the dataset is fixed, I will reuse the data T times. At each iteration or &quot;epoch&quot;, I use each training sample exactly once after randomly reordering the whole training set.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My implementation is based on Python and Numpy. Therefore, using vector operations can remarkably decrease computation time. Coming up with a vectorized implementation of batch gradient descent is quite straightforward. However, in the case of stochastic gradient descent I can not figure out how to avoid the outer loop that iterates through all the samples at each epoch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does anybody know any vectorized implementation of stochastic gradient descent? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT**: I've been asked why would I like to use online gradient descent if the size of my dataset is fixed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From [1], one can see that online gradient descent converges slower than batch gradient descent to the minimum of the empirical cost. However, it converges faster to the minimum of the expected cost, which measures generalization performance. I'd like to test the impact of these theoretical results in my particular problem, by means of cross validation.

By definition, vectorization is a technique for converting operations on one element into operations on a vector of such elements. Thus, no, you cannot process examples one by one and still use vectorization. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can, however, approximate true SGD by using **mini-batches**. Mini-batch is a small subset of original dataset (say, 100 examples). You calculate error and parameter updates based on mini-batches, but you still iterate over many of them without global optimization, making the process stochastic. So, to make your implementation much faster it's enough to change previous line to: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    batches = split dataset into mini-batches&#xD;&#xA;    for batch in batches: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and calculate error from batch, not from a single example. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though pretty obvious, I should also mention vectorization on per-example level.

What I would like to do is search the time series for rules of the type:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given Var3 is in state B in the previous step and Var5 is in state D in the previous step, than Var1 will be in state B. What I want to do is have the rules that include the time interval explicitly.

Then I just want to have rules that say something like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If Var4 and Var5 changed in the previous step than Var1 will change in the current step. Which would be easy for a lag of one, as I could just make the data into something like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;       Var1 Var2 Var3 Var4 Var5 ... VarN Var1_t-1 Var2_t-1 Var3_t-1 ...&#xD;&#xA;and then do sequence mining, but if I want to have rules that aren't just a single lag but could be lags from 1 to 500 than my data set begins to be a little difficult to work with. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Now i want my algorithm to be able to cluster the training sets to according to their features, which here is the frequency of each word in the article. (Note that in this example, each article would have its own unique feature since each article has a different feature, for example an article has 10 &quot;water and 23 &quot;pure&quot; and another has 8 &quot;politics&quot; and 14 &quot;leverage&quot;).

Oryx is based on Apache Mahout (actually one of the creators of Mahout Sean Owen built it) and provides recommendation using collaborative filtering.

I have used it in several projects: recommending products in retail stores (small businesses), building an e-commerce recommender and user similarity from mobile app interaction. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You just have to represent data in the form:&#xD;&#xA;UserId ItemId Value&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where value is a measure (subjective) of the *importance* or *influence* of the interaction between that user and the item. User and item can be anything actually, and the same procedure can be used for tagging. For example, for recommending songs, finding similar songs and bands, and finding similar users according to their music tastes you can represent data as&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;UserId SongId NumberOfPlays&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where NumberOfPlays is the amount of times a song has been played by user (in an online music service for example). This exampl was given in Myrrix the predecessor of Oryx.

H&#xD;&#xA;                 ..&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And so on from times 0 to 1,000,000. What I would like to do is search the time series for rules of the type:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given Var3 is in state B in the previous step and Var5 is in state D in the previous step, than Var1 will be in state B. What I want to do is have the rules that include the time interval explicitly.

Then I just want to have rules that say something like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If Var4 and Var5 changed in the previous step than Var1 will change in the current step. Which would be easy for a lag of one, as I could just make the data into something like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;       Var1 Var2 Var3 Var4 Var5 ... VarN Var1_t-1 Var2_t-1 Var3_t-1 ...&#xD;&#xA;and then do sequence mining, but if I want to have rules that aren't just a single lag but could be lags from 1 to 500 than my data set begins to be a little difficult to work with. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any help would be greatly appreciated. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit to respond to comment:&#xD;&#xA;Each column could be in one of 7 different states. As far as a target, it is non-specific, any rules between the columns would be of interest. However, predicting columns 30-40 and 62-75 would be particularly interesting." />

The key is to have a set of hypotheses (i.e. assumptions \ scenarios that you want to evaluate) and wrangle the data together to prove \ disprove what you thought is true. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few things to watch-out for:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Be ready for Disappointments:** Often times, once you have invested time and energy in building these models, analysts tend to get biased towards publishing results (publication bias). Treat this as an exploration that with a lot of dead-ends and the goal should be to find the ones that are not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Know your Data:** You cannot will your data into doing things magically without truly understanding it. Ensure that you know the different attributes (predictors and dependents) very well. Knowing your data well will allow you to cleanse it and think about appropriate models. All models don't work equally well on all data - data that has a lot of categorical variables might require creative solutions like Dimension reduction before it can be modeled.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Know the &quot;Operational&quot; Processes:** Knowing how things operate within your firm will help you refine the set of hypothesis that you want to test. For e.g. in your scenario above, knowing how developers work with your change management software and what types of administrative setups have been done will help you figure out why the data is coming in the way it is. Some developers might only be focused on certain modules that are more mature than others, might work only on certain shifts and that might limit how many lines of code are checked in, how many bugs are found etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that here are some scenarios you might want to test:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Developer Effectiveness : &#xD;&#xA;How different developers working on same modules overtime has resulted into increase or decrease in bugs. &#xD;&#xA;Does more line of code results in more bugs? Maybe this might be an indicator that the programs need to be split further into smaller components&#xD;&#xA;Folks might be more productive during certain times of day than others - does time of day affect bug introductions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Module Maturity: &#xD;&#xA;Which Modules have the most number of issues? &#xD;&#xA;Are they worked upon by more developers or less?&#xD;&#xA;Do defects keep aging for a long time before they are fixed?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, these questions will change depending on what you are working on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope this helps." />

AUC applies to binary classifiers that have some notion of a decision threshold internally. For example logistic regression returns positive/negative depending on whether the logistic function is greater/smaller than a threshold, usually 0.5 by default. When you choose your threshold, you have a classifier. You have to choose one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a given choice of threshold, you can compute accuracy, which is the proportion of true positives and negatives in the whole data set.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AUC measures how true positive rate (recall) and false positive rate trade off, so in that sense it is already measuring something else. More importantly, AUC is not a function of threshold. It is an evaluation of the classifier as threshold varies over all possible values. It is in a sense a broader metric, testing the quality of the internal value that the classifier generates and then compares to a threshold. It is not testing the quality of a particular choice of threshold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AUC has a different interpretation, and that is that it's also the probability that a randomly chosen positive example is ranked above a randomly chosen negative example, according to the classifier's internal value for the examples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AUC is computable even if you have an algorithm that only produces a ranking on examples. AUC is not computable if you truly only have a black-box classifier, and not one with an internal threshold. These would usually dictate which of the two is even available to a problem at hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AUC is, I think, a more comprehensive measure, although applicable in fewer situations. It's not strictly better than accuracy; it's different. It depends in part on whether you care more about true positives, false negatives, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_F-measure is more like accuracy in the sense that it's a function of a classifier and its threshold setting. But it measures precision vs recall (true positive rate), which is not the same as either above._" />

But there are multiple shortcuts, especially if your domain is limited to cameras/electronics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, you should look at more sites. Many have product brand annotated in the page (proper html annotations, bold font, all caps in the beginning of the name). Some sites have entire pages with brand selectors for search purposes. This way you can create a pretty good starter dictionary of brand names. Same with product line names and even with models. Alphanumeric models can be extracted in bulk by regular expressions and filtered pretty quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are plenty of other tricks, but I'll try to be brief. Just a piece of advice here: there is always a trade-off between manual work and algorithms. Always keep in mind that both approaches can be mixed and both have return-on-invested-time curves, which people tend to forget. If your goal is not to create an automatic algorithm to extract product brands and models, this problem should have limited time budget in your plan.

Although some algorithms can be used for both, this question is in regard to item-item algorithms (thanks for being specific in your question).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Accuracy or effectiveness of recommenders is evaluated based on comparing recommendations to a previously collected data set (training set). For example, I have shopping cart data from the last six months; I'll use the first 5 months as training data, then run my various algorithms, and compare the quality against what really happened during the 6th month.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason Mahout ships with so many algorithms is because different algorithms are more or less effective in each data set you may work with. So, ideally, you do some testing as I described with many algorithms and compare the accuracy, then choose the winner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly, you can also take other factors into account, such as the need to minimize the data set (for performance reasons), and run your tests only with a certain portion of the training data available. In such a case, one algorithm may work better with the smaller data set, but another may work with the complete set. Then, you get to weigh performance VS accuracy VS challenge of implementation (such as deploying on a Hadoop cluster).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, different algorithms are suited for different project. However, there are some general rules:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All algorithms always do better with unreduced data sets (more data is better).&#xD;&#xA;2. More complex algorithms aren't necessarily better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest starting with a simple algorithm and ensuring you have high quality data. If you have additional time, you can implement more complex algorithms and create a comparison which is unique to your data set. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of my info comes from [This study][1].

That in itself is not a reason for concern. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a slightly theoretical point of view, you can ask yourself why you should scale your features and why you should scale them in exactly the chosen way.  &#xD;&#xA;One reason may be that your particular training algorithm is known to converge faster (better) with values around 0 - 1 than with features which cover other orders of magnitude. In that case, you're probably fine. My guess is that your SVM is fine: you want to avoid too large numbers because of the inner product, but a max of 1.2 vs. a max of 1.0 won't make much of a difference.  &#xD;&#xA;(OTOH, if you e.g. knew your algorithm to not accept negative values you'd obviously be in trouble. )&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The practical question is whether your model performs well for cases that are slightly out of the range covered by training. This I believe can best and possibly only be answered by testing with such cases / inspecting test results for performance drop for cases outside the training domain.

This is not a missing data problem, but one where the nature of the problem fundamentally changes. Consider the following example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose I want to predict who will win a race, a simple multinomial classification problem. I have lots of past data on races, plenty to train on.  Lets further suppose I have observed each contestant run multiple races. The problem however is that the number or racers is variable. Sometimes there are only 2 racers, sometimes there are as many as 100 racers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One solution might be to train a separate model for each number or racers, resulting in 99 models in this case, using any method I choose.  E.g. I could have 100 random forests. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another solution might be to include an additional variable called 'number_of_contestants' and have input field for 100 racers and simply leave them blank when no racer is present.  Intuitively, it seems that this method would have difficulties predicting the outcome of a 100 contestant race if the number of racers follows a Poisson distribution (which I didn't originally specify in the problem, but I am saying it here).    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thoughts?" />

All you need is a learner to map a bit string as long as the _total number of contestants_, representing the subset who are taking part, to another bit string (with only one bit set) representing the winner, or a ranked list, if you want them all (assuming you have the whole list in your training data). In the latter case you would have a learning-to-rank problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the contestant landscape can change it would help to find a vector space embedding for them so you can use the previous embeddings as an initial guess and rank anyone, even hypothetical, given their vector representation. As the number of users increases the embedding should stabilize and retraining should become less costly. The question is how to find the embedding, of course. If you have a lot of training data, you could probably find a randomized one along with the ranking function. If you don't, you would have to generate the embedding by some algorithm and estimate only the ranking function.

Here's the gist...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, a few definitions of data science offered by others:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**Josh Wills** from **Cloudera** says](https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656) a data scientist is someone &quot;who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[A frequently-heard **joke**](https://twitter.com/nivertech/status/180109930139893761) is that a &quot;Data Scientist&quot; is a Data Analyst who lives in California.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[According to **Big Data Borat**](https://twitter.com/BigDataBorat/status/372350993255518208), Data Science is statistics on a Mac.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [**Drew Conway's** famous Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), it's the intersection of Hacking Skills, Math &amp; Statistics Knowledge, and Substantive Expertise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's another good definition I found on the [**ITProPortal** blog](http://www.itproportal.com/2014/02/11/how-to-pick-a-data-scientist-the-right-way/):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;A data scientist is someone who understands the domains of programming, machine learning, data mining, statistics, and hacking&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's how we define Data Science at **Altamira** (my current employer):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![data science diagram][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bottom four rows are the **table stakes** -- the cost of admission just to play the game. These are foundational skills that all aspiring data scientists must obtain. Every data scientist must be a **competent programmer**. He or she must also have a solid grasp of math, statistics, and **analytic methodology**. Data science and &quot;**big data**&quot; go hand-in-hand, so all data scientists need to be familiar with frameworks for distributed computing. Finally, data scientists must have a basic understanding of the domains in which they operate, as well as excellent communications skills and the ability to **tell a good story with data**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With these basics covered, the next step is to develop **deep expertise** in one or more of the vertical areas. &quot;Data Science&quot; is really an umbrella term for a collection of interrelated techniques and approaches taken from a variety of disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, and software engineering. The goal of these diverse methods is to **extract actionable intelligence** from data of all kinds, enabling clients to make better **data-driven decisions**. No one person can ever possibly master all aspects of data science; doing so would require multiple lifetimes of training and experience. The best data scientists are therefore &quot;**T-shaped**&quot; individuals -- that is, they possess a breadth of knowledge across all areas of data science, along with deep expertise in at least one. Accordingly, the best **data science teams** bring together a set of individuals with complementary skillsets spanning the **entire spectrum**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/YAUZy.png" />

For a two-class example (e.g. face o no face image) the first weak classifier is selected and then the classification error is found between this classifier and the expected output. For the samples that were misclassified their weights are incremented, so the next weak classifier to find is more biased to neglect this wrong classification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The algorithm (AdaBoost) converges when the sign of the sum of classifications for each sample outputs the correct classification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Y = +1 -1 +1 +1&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    WC1=+1 +1 +1 +1&#xD;&#xA;    WC2=-1 -1 -1 -1&#xD;&#xA;    WC3=+1 -1 +1 +1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the strong classifier is WC1+WC2+WC3:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    SC=+1 -1 +1 +1 == Y&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope this solves your question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The “Premium&#xD;&#xA;1000” series is made with a high quality, supersensitive&#xD;&#xA;emulsion. It is nationally marketed in roll form for&#xD;&#xA;amateurs and sheet and film-pack forms for&#xD;&#xA;professionals.&#xD;&#xA;Roll film is similar to most film commonly used by the&#xD;&#xA;general public.&#xD;&#xA;Sheet film is handled in total darkness, negatives being&#xD;&#xA;withdrawn from between interleaf papers by the&#xD;&#xA;photographer and inserted into a light-tight holder&#xD;&#xA;which is then placed in the camera.&#xD;&#xA;Film-pack is a self-contained unit ready to install in the&#xD;&#xA;camera. The photographer merely pulls a paper tab to&#xD;&#xA;shift the exposed negative out of position and a new&#xD;&#xA;one into position.&#xD;&#xA;The procedure for using and developing all of this film&#xD;&#xA;has not changed since introduction. “Premium 1000” is&#xD;&#xA;produced in small lots at the Denver plant. After&#xD;&#xA;packaging, the film is shipped to dealers across the&#xD;&#xA;country for display and sale; a remarkably stable film&#xD;&#xA;with a shelf life of eighteen months, “Premium 1000”&#xD;&#xA;has an excellent reputation in the trade.&#xD;&#xA;THE SITUATION&#xD;&#xA;During the last 48 hours Sales, Manufacturing and&#xD;&#xA;Research have been working to resolve this sudden and&#xD;&#xA;serious problem with the “Premium 1000” film.&#xD;&#xA;Customer and dealer complaints about fogged sheet&#xD;&#xA;film are mounting. This crisis now requires immediate&#xD;&#xA;action before “Premium 1000” has to be removed from&#xD;&#xA;the market entirely.&#xD;&#xA;During the past ten days, dealers in several sales&#xD;&#xA;districts have had customer complaints of fogged sheet&#xD;&#xA;film. In some cases, dealers have accumulated&#xD;&#xA;complaints for several days before they reported them.&#xD;&#xA;Complaints, mounting every day, have since spread to&#xD;&#xA;all sales districts in the country. Right now there are&#xD;&#xA;complaints from 682 of our 7000 dealers. Although&#xD;&#xA;Sales is replacing each box of fogged film with two new&#xD;&#xA;boxes, this has not placated anyone. Two commercial&#xD;&#xA;studios, for example, threaten total cancellation of&#xD;&#xA;further use of our products because our film, which&#xD;&#xA;they used to photograph unique events, was fogged and&#xD;&#xA;the pictures consequently ruined.&#xD;&#xA;Sales has been very concerned by several&#xD;&#xA;manufacturing problems which have resulted in failures&#xD;&#xA;to meet delivery requirements. For example: a serious&#xD;&#xA;fire two months ago in the “Premium 1000” film&#xD;&#xA;emulsion department resulted in the discharge of&#xD;&#xA;several employees for carelessness and the intensive&#xD;&#xA;training of the new emulsion mixers; delivery quantity&#xD;&#xA;difficulties on interleaf paper for over a month after the&#xD;&#xA;acquisition; delay in arrival of the new bulk raw&#xD;&#xA;ingredient storage containers. Though the interleaf&#xD;&#xA;delivery difficulties cleared up by acquiring a new&#xD;&#xA;suppler, all of the new bulk storage containers have not&#xD;&#xA;arrived and so the old ones are still being used.&#xD;&#xA;Sales of sheet film, as well as film-pack, have quickly&#xD;&#xA;dropped and some professionals have begun using&#xD;&#xA;competitive brands. So far, replacing the fogged film&#xD;&#xA;and Premium’s good reputation has kept most dealers&#xD;&#xA;from defecting.&#xD;&#xA;Sales found that all “Premium 1000” film is shipped,&#xD;&#xA;distributed, stocked and sold by dealers the same way.&#xD;&#xA;They also found that all complaints so far are coming&#xD;&#xA;from small outlets where turnover is very slow, but they&#xD;&#xA;expect to hear complaints from the larger outlets soon.&#xD;&#xA;None of the film was outdated and the fogging was&#xD;&#xA;seen as soon as it was developed rather than later.&#xD;&#xA;Sales asks that we stop production for a couple of days&#xD;&#xA;until Manufacturing thoroughly checks out their&#xD;&#xA;operation (i.e., effects of the fire, effectiveness of&#xD;&#xA;emulsion mixer training, and possible contamination by&#xD;&#xA;the new storage containers). The expense involved in&#xD;&#xA;doing this would be about $30,000.&#xD;&#xA;Manufacturing believes the new zip-top sheet film&#xD;&#xA;package is responsible. Because of substantial&#xD;&#xA;customer complaints that our package was hard to&#xD;&#xA;open, Sales rushed the introduction of the easier to&#xD;&#xA;open zip-top package five weeks ago. There was no Page 2 of 2&#xD;&#xA;time for thorough testing. The problem started since&#xD;&#xA;then. Manufacturing recommends going back to the&#xD;&#xA;former package. It was used for three years without&#xD;&#xA;difficulty. This will gain time to further investigate the&#xD;&#xA;zip-top package. They urge an immediate hold on&#xD;&#xA;expansion of the zip-top package to other “Premium&#xD;&#xA;1000” film. This proposal would require a commitment&#xD;&#xA;of only $20,000, but could invite an added source of&#xD;&#xA;known customer dissatisfaction at this critical time.&#xD;&#xA;Research has conducted tests on sample returns. Their&#xD;&#xA;findings are below.&#xD;&#xA;THE LAB REPORT&#xD;&#xA;Memo from the Research Director (delivered 4 days&#xD;&#xA;after the first reports started coming in)&#xD;&#xA;We have studied the samples of returned fogged film&#xD;&#xA;provided by Sales and have attempted to reproduce the&#xD;&#xA;fogging exactly as it appears on the returns.&#xD;&#xA;We analyzed fifty returned boxes of film and found two&#xD;&#xA;things they all had in common: all negatives in a box are&#xD;&#xA;fogged; fogging is even across the entire surface of each&#xD;&#xA;negative.&#xD;&#xA;We then took thirty-six samples of good sheet film from&#xD;&#xA;the plant warehouse and carefully subjected these to a&#xD;&#xA;variety of tests. The only way we were able to&#xD;&#xA;reproduce exactly the unique fogging effect was to&#xD;&#xA;expose the sheet film to a source of radiation (such as&#xD;&#xA;an x-ray machine).&#xD;&#xA;Recognizing that this type of film is supersensitive and is&#xD;&#xA;more susceptible to contamination, and having clearly&#xD;&#xA;demonstrated that radiation produces the exact&#xD;&#xA;characteristics of the returned fogged film, we believe&#xD;&#xA;that a source of radioactivity is the root of the problem.&#xD;&#xA;We know that traces of radioactive fallout have&#xD;&#xA;contaminated various products in the past.

It is a [lazy learner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_learning) that classifies a new observation by examining the `k` training observations that are closest to the new observation and picks whichever class is most prevalent among those `k` training observations. Note that the distances are *not* relative to a cluster centroid. You don't have to worry about there being more than `k` training observations in the neighborhood of the new observation because the neighborhood isn't based on a threshold distance - it is defined simply by the `k` points nearest to the new observation (i.e., it changes for each new observation being evaluated).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A possible pathological case is when multiple training observations lie at *exactly* the same distance from the new observation, which would require you to evaluate more than `k` neighbors.

It assumes independence among the inputs (hence the &quot;Naive&quot;) and words in a sentence are very dependent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, assuming you really want to run with NB as an algorithm to start your experimentation, there are two options I'd consider:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Ungraceful: Lots of NB classifiers&#xD;&#xA;  This would be an alternative approach.  Make a corupus of all the words observed as your vector of inputs.  Make a corpus off all the tags that are observed as your vector of outputs.  An NB classifier with multiple outputs is the equivalent of having multiple NB classifiers with one output each (so do whichever is easier to implement in whatever software framework you're using).  Treat each element as a training sample where a given input (a word) is a `1` if that word is present and a `0` if that word isn't.  Use the same binary scheme for the output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This brute forces the application of the NB Classifier to your data, and leaves you to find meaning by still haivng to mine the huge set of classifiers you'll be left with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## More Graceful: Process your data&#xD;&#xA;  This is the approach I'd recommend if you want to run with one multiple-class NB Classifier.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your goal here is to figure out how to map each set of tags to a single class.  I'm sure there is some sort of clustering scheme or network analysis (perhaps [&quot;celebrity&quot;] linked to [&quot;murder&quot;] could become a the segment [&quot;debauchery&quot;]) that will sensibly map your tags to one single cluster.  If you treat tags as nodes and two given tags together as links, then you'll want to look into community detection algorithms (which is where I'd start).  But, if you just want something working, then some sort of hack on the tags that converts a list of tags to only the tag that's most commonly seen in your dataset would be enough.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This method front-loads the work of cleaning your data and would make the NB Classifier's output easier to understand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

[Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”](http://www.scala-lang.org/what-is-scala.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### The long answer&#xD;&#xA;Scala is a [functional programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) that runs on the [jvm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).  The 'functional' part of this is a fundamental difference in the language that makes you think differently about programming.  If you like that way of thinking, it lets you quickly work with small data.  Whether you like it or not, functional languages are fundamentally easier to massively scale.  The jvm piece is also important because the jvm is basically everywhere and, thus, Scala code can run basically everywhere.  (Note there are plenty of other [languages written on the jvm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages) and plenty of other [functional programming languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Functional_languages), and languages beyond Scala do appear in both lists.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jg1AheF4n0) give a good overview of the motivation behind Scala.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Re: other tools that have good Scala support:&#xD;&#xA;As you mentioned, Spark (distributable batch processing better at iteratative algorithms than its counterpart) is a big one.  With Spark comes its libraries [Mllib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/) for machine learning and [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/) for graphs.  As mentioned by  Erik Allik and Tris Nefzger, [Akka](http://akka.io) and [Factorie](https://github.com/factorie/factorie) exist.  There is also [Play](https://www.playframework.com/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally,  I can't tell if there is a specific use case you're digging for (if so, make that a part of your question), or just want a survey of big data tools and happen to know Scala a bit and want to start there." />

Premium makes several types of film. The “Premium 1000” series is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; made with a high quality, supersensitive emulsion. It is nationally&#xD;&#xA;&gt; marketed in roll form for amateurs and sheet and film-pack forms for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; professionals.&lt;br&gt; Roll film is similar to most film commonly used by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the general public.&lt;br&gt; Sheet film is handled in total darkness,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; negatives being withdrawn from between interleaf papers by the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; photographer and inserted into a light-tight holder which is then&#xD;&#xA;&gt; placed in the camera. Film-pack is a self-contained unit ready to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; install in the camera. The photographer merely pulls a paper tab to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shift the exposed negative out of position and a new one into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; position. The procedure for using and developing all of this film has&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not changed since introduction. “Premium 1000” is produced in small&#xD;&#xA;&gt; lots at the Denver plant. After packaging, the film is shipped to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dealers across the country for display and sale; a remarkably stable&#xD;&#xA;&gt; film with a shelf life of eighteen months, “Premium 1000” has an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; excellent reputation in the trade. THE SITUATION During the last 48&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hours Sales, Manufacturing and Research have been working to resolve&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this sudden and serious problem with the “Premium 1000” film. Customer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and dealer complaints about fogged sheet film are mounting. This&#xD;&#xA;&gt; crisis now requires immediate action before “Premium 1000” has to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; removed from the market entirely. During the past ten days, dealers in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; several sales districts have had customer complaints of fogged sheet&#xD;&#xA;&gt; film. In some cases, dealers have accumulated complaints for several&#xD;&#xA;&gt; days before they reported them. Complaints, mounting every day, have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; since spread to all sales districts in the country. Right now there&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are complaints from 682 of our 7000 dealers. Although Sales is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; replacing each box of fogged film with two new boxes, this has not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; placated anyone. Two commercial studios, for example, threaten total&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cancellation of further use of our products because our film, which&#xD;&#xA;&gt; they used to photograph unique events, was fogged and the pictures&#xD;&#xA;&gt; consequently ruined. Sales has been very concerned by several&#xD;&#xA;&gt; manufacturing problems which have resulted in failures to meet&#xD;&#xA;&gt; delivery requirements. For example: a serious fire two months ago in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the “Premium 1000” film emulsion department resulted in the discharge&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of several employees for carelessness and the intensive training of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the new emulsion mixers; delivery quantity difficulties on interleaf&#xD;&#xA;&gt; paper for over a month after the acquisition; delay in arrival of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; new bulk raw ingredient storage containers. Though the interleaf&#xD;&#xA;&gt; delivery difficulties cleared up by acquiring a new suppler, all of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the new bulk storage containers have not arrived and so the old ones&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are still being used. Sales of sheet film, as well as film-pack, have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; quickly dropped and some professionals have begun using competitive&#xD;&#xA;&gt; brands. So far, replacing the fogged film and Premium’s good&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reputation has kept most dealers from defecting. Sales found that all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Premium 1000” film is shipped, distributed, stocked and sold by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dealers the same way. They also found that all complaints so far are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coming from small outlets where turnover is very slow, but they expect&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to hear complaints from the larger outlets soon. None of the film was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; outdated and the fogging was seen as soon as it was developed rather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; than later. Sales asks that we stop production for a couple of days&#xD;&#xA;&gt; until Manufacturing thoroughly checks out their operation (i.e.,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; effects of the fire, effectiveness of emulsion mixer training, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; possible contamination by the new storage containers). The expense&#xD;&#xA;&gt; involved in doing this would be about \$30,000. Manufacturing believes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the new zip-top sheet film package is responsible. Because of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; substantial customer complaints that our package was hard to open,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sales rushed the introduction of the easier to open zip-top package&#xD;&#xA;&gt; five weeks ago. There was no Page 2 of 2 time for thorough testing.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The problem started since then. Manufacturing recommends going back to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the former package. It was used for three years without difficulty.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This will gain time to further investigate the zip-top package. They&#xD;&#xA;&gt; urge an immediate hold on expansion of the zip-top package to other&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Premium 1000” film. This proposal would require a commitment of only&#xD;&#xA;&gt; \$20,000, but could invite an added source of known customer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dissatisfaction at this critical time. Research has conducted tests on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sample returns. Their findings are below. THE LAB REPORT Memo from the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Research Director (delivered 4 days after the first reports started&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coming in) We have studied the samples of returned fogged film&#xD;&#xA;&gt; provided by Sales and have attempted to reproduce the fogging exactly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as it appears on the returns. We analyzed fifty returned boxes of film&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and found two things they all had in common: all negatives in a box&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are fogged; fogging is even across the entire surface of each&#xD;&#xA;&gt; negative. We then took thirty-six samples of good sheet film from the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; plant warehouse and carefully subjected these to a variety of tests.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The only way we were able to reproduce exactly the unique fogging&#xD;&#xA;&gt; effect was to expose the sheet film to a source of radiation (such as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an x-ray machine).&lt;br&gt; Recognizing that this type of film is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; supersensitive and is more susceptible to contamination, and having&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clearly demonstrated that radiation produces the exact characteristics&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of the returned fogged film, we believe that a source of radioactivity&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is the root of the problem.

We don't just want to memorize the the link between a given input and a given output (otherwise you wouldn't be modeling data, you'd be memorizing 1:1 connections with a dict / hash / relational database table / etc).  We want to capture the underlying pattern in the data from only looking at the training data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's expand a little on your gravity example.  You have your 10 training samples showing the start and ending position of an object dropped.  For consistency, let's say the object was dropped the moment the object's location was initially recorded and the ending location was recorded at some precise time interval later (but before the object hit the ground).  Let's also say the model (neural network in this case) managed to precisely learn the expected change in location since it just comes down to subtraction in one axis.  You can show it another 10, 100, 1000 examples that all leverage the connection found and your model will keep performing well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why not keep going to 10k, 100k, or even more samples?  Theoretically, if you managed to isolate the connection and run the experiment the same way each time, your model will always work.  But realistically, something is going to eventually change in the system.  You hire a new lab assistant who tends to press the 'record location' button well after having dropped the object (giving the object more initial velocity, which you won't notice having only recorded location).  Maybe you lost your initial ball and had to use something else which is lighter and catches the wind more (so it goes slower).  .... the longer you run the experiment, the more small changes will creep into your system.  Eventually these changes will alter the connection enough to make your initial model wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When modeling data, we want to capture the underlying patterns and acknowledge that the model only matters as long as those underlying patterns stay relevant.  It's not really about the number of samples.  It's about the connections / the model itself.  The number of samples just happens to be one of the better proxies we have - the more samples you use, the more confident you have some underlying pattern.  'Statistical validity' is one stab at solving this, though it's validity is still up for question in the era of big data.  There is [plenty of work](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5726612&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5726612) done trying to solve for how to gain confidence in good generalization in neural networks specifically, but it's still very much an open question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a different example, if you're looking at user behavior, you'll see differences between day and night; weekdays and weekends; summer and winter; year of a person's life; culture a person grew up in... even if you prove you found a pattern in your initial sample, the system will eventually change and it's up to luck whether the connection(s) you found are a part of the system that changed or a part of the system that didn't.&#xD;&#xA;" />

A **comprehensive** review of **all** these offerings is IMHO an enormous task and is **far** beyond an answer here on Stack Exchange or, even, a lengthy blog post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, nowadays one is not limited to *traditional educational options* and I think it's important to be aware of **other educational options**. One of the other options include **certifications** (linked at the above-mentioned page, but, in my opinion, the only certification worth considering is the [Certified Analytics Professional](https://www.informs.org/Certification-Continuing-Ed/Analytics-Certification) as a *solid* and *vendor-neutral* certification from a reputable INFORMS). Another option is recently booming **data science intensive educational offerings**, from *short-term* (and often too commercial, to put it lightly) *bootcamps* to *more solid offerings*, including free, but competitive, ones, such as [Insight Data Science Fellows Program](http://insightdatascience.com), where one needs to be a PhD to apply, or its sister program [Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program](http://www.insightdataengineering.com), which doesn't have such requirement. Finally, there is yet another option: **self-study**. It partially intersects with the certificate option, if one uses *massive open online courses (MOOC)* (a review of which deserves a separate comprehensive post), but there are **open curricula** that might suit one better, such as the *Open Source Data Science Masters* curriculum, linked in my [earlier relevant answer](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/742/2452).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**P.S.** While your answer focused on data science, I think that it may be wise to at least consider another career path, given your *math background*. I'm talking about **operations research** field, which is not that far away from data science (and even somewhat intersects with it). While similar, data science is IMHO more statistics-focused, whereas operations research is more math-focused, at least that's how I see it. Despite all the popularity and &quot;gold rush&quot; of data science, operations research career is a solid one, just not as hot. Of course, if you're excited about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning and, especially, deep learning, data science career is the way to go. Whatever you will choose, the good thing is that with your math background it will be easy to change focus, should you decide to. Hope this helps. Good luck!" />

I've picked up what I know over the course of the last year or so largely from academic papers and sites like this, but I've not found anything that answers one area I'm really unsure about:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm working on a time series data set of energy meter readings. The length of the series varies by meter - for some I have several years, others only a few months, etc. Many display significant seasonality, and often multiple layers - higher use at certain times of day for instance, or at certain points in the week (weekend vs. weekday, usually), or over the course of the year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To give some background, one of the things I've been working on is clustering of these time series. I did some initial work where I calculated various features (percentage used on weekends vs. weekday, percentage used in different time blocks, etc.). I then moved on to looking at using DTW to obtain the distance, and clustering based on that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My concern is this: the time series can change in seasonality, especially in the longer series where I have years' worth of readings for a meter. Some cases might be quite extreme (like a meter no longer consuming energy), but other cases could simply be a meter showing a different day/night pattern or a move towards consuming in the same pattern all week instead of showing a regular pattern on weekdays followed by a couple of low, &quot;flat&quot; days on the weekend. If I'm clustering in either of the above ways, it strikes me that I could end up with some incorrect distances, and with time series which behave very differently from one another clustered together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How do I avoid or deal with this? I've been wondering whether I need to split the series where things like this happen, but I'm not sure how I'd detect instances of it in order to do so (the data set is too big to do that manually), and I'm honestly just not sure if that's a suitable thing to do, anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apologies if this is a silly question and easily answered via some online resource, I'm struggling to find a way to search for any guides or academic papers which discuss the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. - I can't post in Meta or even a comment yet, so sorry for the off-topic bit, but: I love this site and hope it picks up steam! I was so happy when I found it, I immediately found topics which weren't covered at all or as helpfully at SO and CV. I feel a lot more comfortable asking this question here because it's not a pure statistics question or a programming question. I would feel like I was asking something potentially off-topic at either of those sites, and I feel like I'm more likely to get an answer which really covers my question and which I can understand by asking here." />

Two common ways to do this is to place constraints on when a new decision can be created (a minimum of data in a leaf, significant increase in information, etc) or more simply to limit the max depth of the tree." />

It is also useful for development of small systems and rapid prototyping because it takes less lines of code than some other languages and it has an interactive mode for fast feedback. One notable Scala framework is Akka which uses the actor model of concurrent computation. Many of Odersky's presentations are on YouTube and there is a list of tools implemented with Scala on wiki.scala-lang.org.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An implicit point is that tools and frameworks written in Scala inherently have Scala integration and usually a Scala API. Then other APIs may be added to support other languages beginning with Java since Scala is already integrated and in fact critically depends on Java.  If a tool or framework is not written in Scala, it is unlikely that it offers any support for Scala.  That is why in answer to your question I have pointed towards tools and frameworks written in Scala and Spark is one example.  However, Scala currently has a minor share of the market but its adoption rate is growing and the high growth rate of Spark will enhance that. The reason I use Scala is because Spark's API for Scala is richer than the Java and Python APIs. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main reasons I prefer Scala generally is because it is much more expressive than Java because it allows and facilitates the use of functions as objects and values while retaining object oriented modularity, which enables development of complex and correct programs with far less code than Java which I had preferred because of widespread use, clarity and excellent documentation." />

Text="This is a **tricky** question, because it's easy and difficult at the same time. *Easy*, because there is a lot of resources that potentially can help you make a decision on the topic. *Difficult*, because the situation is very different for a particular person (not to mention that their interest might change at any time), which makes extremely difficult for other people to give you a **good** advice and for you to make the **right** decision.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for **data science career** options, you can certainly consider a **degree path** (MS or MS + PhD), but you need to be aware of **other options**. For a comprehensive resource, dedicated to **data science and related degree programs** (both *traditional* and *online*), please visit this page: http://www.kdnuggets.com/education/index.html. A **comprehensive** review of **all** these offerings is IMHO an enormous task and is **far** beyond an answer here on Stack Exchange or, even, a lengthy blog post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, nowadays one is not limited to *traditional educational options* and I think it's important to be aware of **other educational options**. One of the other options include **certifications** (linked at the above-mentioned page, but, in my opinion, the only certification worth considering is the [Certified Analytics Professional](https://www.informs.org/Certification-Continuing-Ed/Analytics-Certification) as a *solid* and *vendor-neutral* certification from a reputable INFORMS). Another option is recently booming **data science intensive educational offerings**, from *short-term* (and often too commercial, to put it lightly) *bootcamps* to *more solid offerings*, including free, but competitive, ones, such as [Insight Data Science Fellows Program](http://insightdatascience.com), where one needs to be a PhD to apply, or its sister program [Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program](http://www.insightdataengineering.com), which doesn't have such requirement. Finally, there is yet another option: **self-study**. It partially intersects with the certificate option, if one uses *massive open online courses (MOOC)* (a review of which deserves a separate comprehensive post), but there are **open curricula** that might suit one better, such as the *Open Source Data Science Masters* curriculum, linked in my [earlier relevant answer](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/742/2452).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**P.S.** While your question focuses on data science, I think that it may be wise to at least consider another career path, given your *math background*. I'm talking about **operations research** field, which is not that far away from data science (and even somewhat intersects with it). While similar, data science is IMHO more statistics-focused, whereas operations research is more math-focused, at least that's how I see it. Despite all the popularity and &quot;gold rush&quot; of data science, operations research career is a solid one, just not as hot. Of course, if you're excited about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning and, especially, deep learning, data science career is the way to go. Whatever you will choose, the good thing is that with your math background it will be easy to change focus, should you decide to. Hope this helps. Good luck!" />

My suggestion is to start with 9*2 = 18 to cover a wider range of possibilities.&#xD;&#xA; - Be sure your test and validation sets are selected &quot;fairly&quot;: a random selection and varying the seed some number of times to test different configurations would be ok.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, a number of neurons equal to the number of features will tend to make each hidden neuron try to learn *that special thing* that each feature is adding, so will could say it is &quot;learning each feature&quot; separately. Although this sounds good it might tend to overfitting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since your number of inputs and your dataset size is small its ok to start with a hidden layer size of the double (18) and start lowering down. When the training error and test error stabilize in a difference lower than a threshold then you could have found a better generalizing model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neural networks are very good at finding local optima by exploring deeply a solution from a starting point. However, the starting point it is also very important. If you are not getting a good generalization you might try to find good initial starting points with methods of Hybrid Neural Networks. A common one, for example, is using genetic algorithms to find an initial combination of weights and then start the neural from that point. Given that your search space would be better covered (in case your problem actually needs that).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for every problem in machine learning is very important to clean your data before introducing it to the NN. Try to be very detailed in order to avoid the NN to learn things you already know. For example if you know how two features are correlated improve the input data by making this correlation explicit so less workload is given to the NN (that might actually get you in trouble)." />

These questions may have between 2 and 4 answers each, and for the sake of simplicity, let's pretend that the formula for a match% $\ M $ between you and another user is given by&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;$\ M = Q_a/Q_c $&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where $\ Q_c $ is the number of questions you and the other user have in common, and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;$\ Q_a $ is the number of questions you both answered with the same value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The real formula is slightly more complex, but the approach would be the same regarding &quot;picking&quot; a correct answer (he actually used boosting to find the ideal &quot;importance&quot; to place on a given question, rather than the right answer).&#xD;&#xA;In any case, the point is you want to pick a certain value for each question, such that you maximize your match% with as many users as possible - something you might quantify by the sum of $\ M $ over all users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now I've watched the MIT course on AI up to and including the lecture on boosting, but I don't understand how you would apply it to a problem like this. Honestly I don't even know where to begin with choosing rules for the weak learners. I don't have any &quot;rules&quot; about what values to choose for each question (if the user is under 5'5, choose A, etc) - I'm just trying to fit the data I have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this not the way boosting is supposed to be used?

Text="Background&#xD;&#xA;==========&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm working on a time series data set of energy meter readings.

After several years, it changes to a pattern where energy usage is higher during the summer months before returning to the usual amount.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Possible Directions&#xD;&#xA;===================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I've wondered whether I can continue to compare whole time series, but split them and consider them as a separate series if the pattern changes considerably. However, to do this I'd need to be able to detect such changes. Also, I just don't know if this is a suitable way or working with the data.&#xD;&#xA; - I've also considered splitting the data and considering it as many separate time series. For instance, I could consider every day/meter combination as a separate series. However, I'd then need to do similarly if I wanted to consider the weekly/monthly/yearly patterns. I *think* this would work, but it's potentially quite onerous and I'd hate to go down this path if there's a better way that I'm missing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further Notes&#xD;&#xA;=============&#xD;&#xA;These are things that have come up in comments, or things I've thought of due to comments, which might be relevant. I'm putting them here so people don't have to read through everything to get relevant information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I'm working in Python, but have rpy for those places where R is more suitable. I'm not necessarily looking for a Python answer though - if someone has a practical answer of what should be done I'm happy to figure out implementation details myself.&#xD;&#xA; - I have a lot of working &quot;rough draft&quot; code - I've done some DTW runs, I've done a couple of different types of clustering, etc. I think I largely understand the direction I'm taking, and what I'm really looking for is related to how I process my data before finding distances, running clustering, etc. Given this, I suspect the answer would be the same whether the distances between series are calculated via DTW or a simpler Euclidean Distance (ED).&#xD;&#xA; - I have found these papers especially informative on time series and DTW and they may be helpful if some background is needed to the topic area: http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/selected_publications.htm&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. - I can't post in Meta or even a comment yet, so sorry for the off-topic bit, but: I love this site and hope it picks up steam!

The comportement of the client also depends on their awareness wich depends on the evolution of rates. I've added this in model using past 6 month rates as features. I am currently fitting polynomials objectives functions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact media coverage of rate mostly depends on rate variations and I wanted to add that in my model.  The idea would be to add a derivative/variation of rate as a feature. But I anticipated something wrong, example with only two month , my variation will be of the form $x_1 - x_{2}$ that is a simple linear combination of $x_1$, my actual rate and $x_{2}$ the past month rate. I feel like this variation does not add anything to the objective function i am trying to fit to my data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was thinking about a better interpolation of my curve to have a better idea of my derivative. For example, a cubic spline interpolation of my curve so that the derivative will be a bit more than a difference. The splines will have a polynomial expression of x and my features, wich give a polynomial expression of my feature when i calculate the derivative in one point. In the end, adding these features will only change the order of the objective function. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this a general idea ? all information is somewhat directly contained in data and modifications of features will result in higher order objective function ?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After fitting my function how do I look for the influence of variation ? With the 2 month example, if I end up with the objective function $a x_1 + b x_2$ and I rewrite it as $ \frac{a+b}{2} (x_1 + x_2) + \frac{a-b}{2} (x_1 - x_2)$, $\frac{a-b}{2}$ would be the influence of variation ? What would be the interpretation of $ \frac{a+b}{2}$ ? Is this generalisable to higher number of feature ? higher order of objective function ?

If I had the reputation to comment I'd ask you a few things first, but I can't. I'll happily do further work and edit this response if you respond or make edits to your question. With those caveats out of the way:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it useful to use the previous value as a feature?&#xD;&#xA;====================================================&#xD;&#xA;One of the first things I would say is that the correct aspects to be looking at in your data very much depends on the nature of the data, as well as what you're trying to do with it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - It sounds like you have monthly values, but it's not clear how far into the future you're wanting to predict, or how much historic data you have access to.&#xD;&#xA; - We also don't know what these two series represent, or why one time series is being used to predict the other - and without that, I don't think anyone will be able to tell you whether the previous value of the series to be predicted is valuable information or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any caveats to using a 6 month time window?&#xD;&#xA;===========================================&#xD;&#xA;One obvious caveat to only using the last 6 months is that if there's any seasonality over the year-long period then you're going to miss it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If you're not sure: if you have multiple years of information, try plotting the series you want to predict over multiple years. You may well be able to see whether the series generally increases or decreases at certain times of year. If you can share this plot here, it might help people answer your questions in more depth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as caveats about this time-window approach, I'm not too clear from your post what algorithm you're using to predict values. More information on that would be helpful; it's possible that rather than questioning what features to select, you should be questioning what methodology to use for forecasting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Helpful further reading?&#xD;&#xA;========================&#xD;&#xA;Once you've provided more information I'll be happy to tackle your last question on suitable reading if I'm able to. For now, I will say that there's a *lot* of information available, but a lot of it is academic in nature. Quite frequently papers aren't easy to digest, seem to contradict one another, or are only relevant to specific situations. This is a rapidly growing and changing field, so it's sometimes difficult to find a clear best practice or consensus opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, it might be worth looking at some of the free, online courses available to see if any would help you understand the area you're interested in:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Coursera &quot;data science&quot; related courses][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=data%20science" />

In case you don't know, these models are called autoregressive (AR) models. This answers your first question. Of course it is useful to include the previous value of your time series. There is a whole set of models based on that idea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second approach is taking a window and extracting some features to describe the time series at each point in time. Then you use a conventional machine learning technique to predict future values as typically done. This is more common in a classification or regression setting but future values can be thought of as classifying future values. This technique has the advantage of dramatically reducing the number of features, although you usually lose characteristics associated with time. This addresses your second concern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another model that could be helpful in your case is the vector autoregressive model (VAR) (using [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression)'s notation):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;$$\left( \begin{array}{ccc}&#xD;&#xA;y_{1,t} \\&#xD;&#xA;y_{2,t} &#xD;&#xA;\end{array}\right) = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}c_{1} \\ c_{2}\end{array}\right) + \left( \begin{array}{ccc}A_{1,1} &amp; A_{1,2} \\ A_{2,1} &amp; A_{2,2}\end{array}\right)\left( \begin{array}{ccc}&#xD;&#xA;y_{1,t-1} \\&#xD;&#xA;y_{2,t-1} &#xD;&#xA;\end{array}\right) + \left( \begin{array}{ccc}&#xD;&#xA;e_{1,t} \\&#xD;&#xA;e_{2,t} &#xD;&#xA;\end{array}\right)$$&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here you can see that $y_{1,t}$ has a contribution from its previous value $t_{1,t-1}$ but also includes the value of the other series $y_{2,t-1}$ in a linear combination. As usual, the purpose is to find the elements of $A_{i,j}$ that minimize some measure of error between observed values and estimated values.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A general suggestion: The first thing you need to do is to test the autocorrelation of your first series in order to confirm that an autoregressive approach is suitable and then test the cross correlation between both series to support the idea that using the second series to improve your predictions is appropriate." />

The more states your variable can take, the much more data you'll need to train it.  It sounds like you're reducing the feature space through some front-end processing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Example&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Context:&#xD;&#xA;Say you're using NBC to model if you go outside given the high temperature that day.  Let's say temperature is given to you as an int in Celsius which just happened to range between 0 and 40 degrees.  Over one year of running the experiment - recording the temperature and if you went outside - you'll have 365 data points.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Internal Representation:&#xD;&#xA;The internal structure the NBC uses will be a matrix with 82 values (41 values for your one input variable * 2 because you have two states in your output class).  That means each bin will have an average of `365/82 = 8.9ish` samples.  In practice, you'll probably see a few bins with lots more samples than this and a many bins with 0 samples.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### A Pitfall&#xD;&#xA;Say you saw 8 cases at a temperature of 5 C (all of which you stayed inside) and nothing at a temp of 3 or 4 C.  If, after the model is built, you 'ask it' what class a temp of 4 C should be in.  It won't know.  Intuitively, we'd say &quot;stay inside&quot;, but the model won't.  One way to fix this is to bin the classes 0,1,2,... into larger groups of temperatures (i.e., class 0 for temp 0-3, class 1 for temp 4-7, etc).  The extreme case of this would be two temperature states &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;.  The actual cut-off should depend more on the data observed, but one such scheme is converting temperatures within `0-20` to &quot;low&quot; and `21-40` is &quot;high&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Discussion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This front end processing seems to be what you're talking about as the &quot;wrapper&quot; around the NBC.  The result of our &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; binning scheme will result in a much smaller model (2 input states and 2 output classes gives you a `2*2 = 4` number of classes.  This will be way easier to process and will take way less data to confidently train at the expense of complexity.  One example of a drawback of such a scheme is:  Say the actual pattern is that you love spring and fall weather and only go outside when it's not too hot or not too cold.  So your outside adventures are evenly split across the upper part of the &quot;low&quot; class and the lower part of the &quot;high&quot; class giving you a really useless model.  If this were the case, a 3-class bin scheme of &quot;high&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and &quot;low&quot; would be best." />

With the monthly dataset you have 120 data points, which is sufficient to get a timeseries model even with seasonality in your data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To obtain say weekly or monthly data from daily data, you can use smoothing functions. For financial data, you can use moving average or exponential smoothing, but if those do not work for your data, then you can use the spline smoothing function &quot;smooth.spline&quot; in R: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/smooth.spline.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The model returned will have less noise than the original daily dataset, and you can get values for the desired time points. Finally, these data points can be used in your timeseries analysis. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from weekly/monthly to daily data ?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To obtain daily data when you have monthly or weekly data, you can use interpolation. First, you should find an equation to describe the data. In order to do this you should plot the data (e.g. price over time). When factors are known to you, this equation should be influenced by those factors. When factors are unknown, you can use a best fit equation. The simplest would be a linear function or piecewise linear function, but for financial data this won't work well. In that case, you should consider piecewise cubic spline interpolation. This link goes into more detail on possible interpolation functions: http://people.math.gatech.edu/~meyer/MA6635/chap2.pdf. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In R, there is a method for doing interpolation of timeseries data. Here you would create a vector with say weekly values and NAs in the gaps for the daily values, and then use the &quot;interpNA&quot; function to get the interpolated values for the NAs. However, this function uses the &quot;approx&quot; function to get the interpolated values, which applies either a linear or constant interpolation. To perform cubic spline interpolation in R, you should use the &quot;splinefun&quot; function instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Something to be aware of is that timeseries models typically do some sort of averaging to forecast future values whether you are looking at exponential smoothing or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) methods amongst others. So a timeseries model to forecast daily values may not be the best choice, but the weekly or monthly models may be better. " />

Given only the day someone ran a query, how can you tell what time of day that query was ran?  You may be able to make some inferences, but the only way to answer the question is to directly or indirectly bring in more information to the system.

Of course, plain text is compatible with anything.  But e.g. Pandas has a [host of IO tools](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html) that simplifies reading from certain formats.

Binary means here that the stored files will be smaller and therefore faster to read and write.

I think that the solution is rather simple - get the best computer that your budget allows.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, since you want to focus on `R` development and one of `R`'s pressing issues is its [critical dependence](http://stackoverflow.com/q/5171593/2872891) on the amount of available *physical memory* (RAM), I would suggest favoring more RAM to other parameters. The second most important parameter, in my opinion, would be *number of cores* (or *processors* - see details below), due to your potential *multiprocessing* focus. Finally, the two next most important criteria I'd pay attention to would be *compatibility* with Linux and system/manufacturer's *quality*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as the *storage* goes, I suggest considering *solid state drives (SSD)*, if you'd rather prefer to have a bit more more speed than more space (however, if your work will involve intensive disk operations, you might want to investigate the issue of SSD *reliability* or consult with people, knowledgeable in this matter). However, I think that for R-focused work, disk operations are much less critical than memory ones, as I've mentioned above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When choosing a specific *Linux distribution*, I suggest using a well-supported one, such as Debian or, even better, Ubuntu (if you care more about support, choose their LTS version). I'd rather not buy parts and assemble custom box, but some people would definitely prefer that route - for that you really need to know hardware well, but potential compatibility could still be an issue. The next paragraph provides some examples for both *commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)* and *custom* solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Should you be interested in the *custom system* route, [this discussion](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/295552-28-multiprocessor-multicore-system-rendering-workstation) might be worth reading, as it contains some interesting pricing numbers (just to get an idea of potential savings) and also sheds some light on *multiprocessor vs. multi-core* alternatives (obviously, the *context* is different, but nevertheless could be useful). As I said, I would go the COTS route, mainly due to reliability and compatibility issues. In terms of single-processor multi-core systems, your budget is more than enough. However, when we go to multiprocessor workstations (I'm not even talking about servers), even two-processor configurations can go over your budget easily. Some, not far away, such as [HP Z820 Workstation](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/workstations/z820.html). It starts from 2439 USD, but in minimal configuration. When you upgrade it to match your desired specs (if it's even possible), I'm sure that we'll be talking about 5K USD price range (extrapolating from the series' higher-level models). What I like about HP Z820, though, is the fact that this system is [Ubuntu certified](http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201011-6754). Considering system compatibility and assuming your desire to run Ubuntu, the best way to approach your problem is to go through [Ubuntu-certified hardware lists](http://www.ubuntu.com/certification) and shortlist systems that you like. Just for the sake of completeness, take a look at this [interesting multiprocessor system](http://www.mediaworkstations.net/i-x2.html), which in compatible configuration might cost less than from HP or other major vendors. However, it's multimedia-oriented as well as it's reliability and compatibility are unknown, not to mention that it's way over your specified budget.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of `R` and `R`-focused software, I highly recommend you to use *RStudio Server* instead of *RStudio*, as that will provide you with an opportunity to be able to work from any Internet-enabled location (provided you computer will be running, obviously). Another advice that I have is to keep an eye on *alternative `R` distributions*. I'm not talking about commercial expensive ones, but about emerging open source projects, such as `pqR`: http://www.pqr-project.org. Will update as needed. I hope this is helpful." />

There are techniques you can use to avoid comparing an item against *all* others at query-time such as building a spatial index or using a heuristic that selects only a subset of items that are not too far away. PostgreSQL can create an [index on character trigrams](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/pgtrgm.html) in strings that enables efficient querying for strings that are sufficiently similar (measured by the Jaccard similarity coefficient).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Storing an $N$ column wide table is not possible because the maximum number of columns allowed in MySQL is 4096.

If there are more buyer initiated trades in a given second, then that second's data point would contain a positive value in the pertinent feature. If there are more seller initiated trades, then there would be a negative value. And if either there is an equal amount of buy vs seller initiated trades OR if there are simply not any trades in a given second, there will be a 0 for the feature in that data point. Along with this feature, there are several other features that are based on what occurred in the preceding seconds (eg if the value discussed above was 12 for the data point immediately preceding the current point, then the second feature for the current data point would be 12 - please let me know if this is not clear) After much troubleshooting, I have concluded that if there are too many data points with too many 0's for features, the classifier simply wont work. When I print out the probabilities of evaluation data points falling into different classes, I simply get&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    0:NaN,1:NaN&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;for all model evaluation points I try to classify. (I am using logistic regression from apache-mahout. In total have 183 features, but over 40million data points. There are three categories to which the data point can be classified)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have found that if I set the default value to 1, then I no longer encounter this error, e.g. if there are no trades, the value will be a 1, if there is one seller initiated trade, the value will be 0.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So with all this in mind, I have two related questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Has anyone else encountered this issue? e.g. if you have a vector with x features, and for a majority of the data points, a majority of the features contain 0's, is this know to give issues?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Is shifting all values up by a constant (such as 1) a valid fix to this issue?

The initial query should have some words as a reference point to compare to the words in the document. Not knowing whether the query is a sentence or arbitrary list, you are restricted to a method that does some kind of histogram comparison of the frequency of the words matching in the documents. You can perform naive summations of keyword mappings counts, look at keyword likelihoods in the normalized distributions, or give a distribution of weighting based on the strongest matches. More exotic functions will be based on your prior belief of how the words should be compared. Working within a Bayesian Framework you can see your prior assumptions explicitly. Cosine similarity or any other vector based measure will be slightly arbitrary without knowing the desired nature of comparison between query and document.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is not much more you can do without looking at some type of features, or attempt to cross compare the documents together, or use the initial query's structure. In short, my answer is to use normalized frequency similarities of the document to the queries and produce a ranking, and with more specific goals in mind to apply measures like cosine similarity on test datasets to search for the best measure.

As you've demonstrated, nothing is gained by adding linear combination of other features (like the derivative) as a new feature in a linear model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may want a derivative coefficient to help interpret the model. You could use the normal model $x_{n+1} = a * x_n + b * n_{n-1}$ and then report the value $a-b$ to the client. A more general approach is to examine the [frequency response][1] of the model (the derivative is a high-pass filter, your model is a FIR filter).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternately you can rotate the basis of the input such that the derivative is a feature and the dimensions are still independent as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can think of the independent variables $x_n$ and $x_{n-1}$ as forming a [standard basis][2] for the two dimensions of your model's input, that is $\langle 1, 0\rangle$ and $\langle 0, 1\rangle$. &#xD;&#xA;Neither $a\langle 1, 0 \rangle$ or $b \langle 0, 1 \rangle$ are orthogonal to  c$\langle1, -1\rangle$.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, **if you want to use $c(x_n - x_{n-1})$ as a feature, I would also use the orthogonal feature $d(x_n + x_{n-1})$**.

Say, you moderate a web forum which is sometimes flooded with spam messages. These messages are easily identifiable - most often they contain specific words like &quot;buy&quot;, &quot;porn&quot;, etc. and a URL to outer resources. You want to create filter that will alert you about such suspecious messages. It turns to be pretty easy - you get list of features (e.g. list of suspicious words and presence of a URL) and train simple logistic regression (a.k.a. perceptron), i.e. model like: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    g(w0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wnxn)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where `x1..xn` are your features (either presence of specific word or a URL), `w0..wn` - learned coefficients and `g()` is a [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) to make result be between 0 and 1. It's very simple classifier, but for this simple task it may give very good results, creating linear decision boundary. Assuming you used only 2 features, this boundary may look something like this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![linear boundary](http://www.mblondel.org/images/perceptron_linear.png)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here 2 axes represent features (e.g. number of occurrences of specific word in a message, normalized around zero), red points stay for spam and blue points - for normal messages, while black line shows separation line. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But soon you notice that some good messages contain a lot of occurrences of word &quot;buy&quot;, but no URLs, or extended discussion of [porn detection](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/713247/what-is-the-best-way-to-programatically-detect-porn-images), not actually refferring to porn movies. Linear decision boundary simply cannot handle such situations. Instead you need something like this: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![non-linear boundary](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/courses/MachineLearning/exercises/ex8materials/ex8b_100.png)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This new non-linear decision boundary is much more **flexible**, i.e. it can fit the data much closer. There are many ways to achieve this non-linearity - you can use polynomial features (e.g. `x1^2`) or their combination (e.g. `x1*x2`) or project them out to a higher dimension like in [kernel methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method). But in neural networks it's common to solve it by **combining perceptrons** or, in other words, by building [**multilayer perceptron**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron). Non-linearity here comes from logistic function between layers. The more layers, the more sophisticated patterns may be covered by MLP. Single layer (perceptron) can handle simple spam detection, network with 2-3 layers can catch tricky combinations of features, and networks of 5-9 layers, used by large research labs and companies like Google, may model the whole language or detect cats on images. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is essential reason to have **deep architectures** - they can *model more sophisticated patterns*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why deep networks are hard to train? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With only one feature and linear decision boundary it's in fact enough to have only 2 training examples - one positive and one negative. With several features and/or non-linear decision boundary you need several orders more examples to cover all possible cases (e.g. you need not only find examples with `word1`, `word2` and `word3`, but also with all possible their combinations). And in real life you need to deal with hundreds and thousands of features (e.g. words in a language or pixels in an image) and at least several layers to have enough non-linearity. Size of a data set, needed to fully train such networks, easily exceeds 10^30 examples, making it totally impossible to get enough data. In other words, with many features and many layers our decision function becomes **too flexible** to be able to learn it **precisely**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are, however, ways to learn it _approximately_. For example, if we were working in probabilistic settings, then instead of learning frequencies of all combinations of all features we could assume that they are independent and learn only individual frequencies, reducing full and unconstrained [Bayes classifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_classifier) to a [Naive Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) and thus requiring much, much less data to learn. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In neural networks there were several attempts to (meaningfully) reduce complexity (flexibility) of decision function. For example, convolutional networks, extensively used in image classification, assume only local connections between nearby pixels and thus try only learn combinations of pixels inside small &quot;windows&quot; (say, 16x16 pixels = 256 input neurons) as opposed to full images (say, 100x100 pixels = 10000 input neurons). Other approaches include feature engineering, i.e. searching for specific, human-discovered descriptors of input data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Manually discovered features are very promising actually. In natural language processing, for example, it's sometimes helpful to use special dictionaries (like those containing spam-specific words) or catch negation (e.g. &quot;_not_ good&quot;). And in computer vision things like [SURF descriptors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SURF) or [Haar-like features](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_features) are almost irreplaceable. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the problem with manual feature engineering is that it takes literally years to come up with good descriptors. Moreover, these features are often specific &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Unsupervised pretraining&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But it turns out that we can _obtain good features automatically_ right from the data using such algorithms as **autoencoders** and **restricted Boltzmann machines**. I described them in detail in my other [answer](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/114385/what-is-the-difference-between-convolutional-neural-networks-restricted-boltzma/117188#117188), but in short they allow to **find repeated patterns in the input data** and transform it into higher-level features. For example, given only row pixel values as an input, these algorithms may identify and pass higher whole edges, then from these edges construct figures and so on, until you get really high-level descriptors like variations in faces. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![deep learning](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oGBRR.jpg)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After such (unsupervised) pretraining network is usually converted into MLP and used for normal supervised training. Note, that pretraining is done layer-wise. This significantly reduces solution space for learning algorithm (and thus number of training examples needed) as it only needs to learn parameters _inside_ each layer without taking into account other layers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### And beyond...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unsupervised pretraining have been here for some time now, but recently other algorithms were found to improve learning both - together with pretraining and without it. One notable example of such algorithms is [**dropout**](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf) - simple technique, that randomly &quot;drops out&quot; some neurons during training, creatig some distortion and preventing networks of following data too closely. This is still a hot research topic, so I leave this to a reader. " />

While his&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dissertation work continued to run on the side, he set up 12 fake&#xD;&#xA;&gt; OkCupid accounts and wrote a Python script to manage them.

McKinlay set up his bots to simply answer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; each question randomly—he wasn’t using the dummy profiles to attract&#xD;&#xA;&gt; any of the women, so the answers didn’t mat­ter—then scooped the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; women’s answers into a database. &quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So he used python scripts to collect lots of information! At the end of this, he had a table of data, where each row had three pieces of information:&#xD;&#xA;- A bot's answer to all the questions, and their weights&#xD;&#xA;- A woman's answer to all the questions&#xD;&#xA;- Their match percentage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this, he could use AdaBoost to create a predictive model, predicting the match percentage from the available information. The weak learners were probably decision stumps, greedily choosing one variable at a time to split on, that's the standard that people refer to when talking about AdaBoost. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the predictive model, was in place, it could be used for optimization - determining which weights to put on the questions when holding all other variables constant, maximizing the average match percentage to women in his target audience. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, this is just a guess.

In the case of supervised learning you assume there is a function $f:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$, which means there is a connection somehow between inputs and outputs and you want to use it in order to predict. But how this function might look? Without considering the model itself, usually what happens is that there is some noise. And this noise can be in $Y$ and also can be in $X$. This noise gives use the probabilistic setup of the problem, because without it we would have only to solve some equations. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Now is important to understand that the noise defines the distribution. So a random variable can be imagined as a function having something fixed and well defined and something not fixed, but taking values according with a distribution. If the variable part does not exist, that you would not have a random variable, right, it would be a simple formula. But its not. Now the $P(X)$ incorporates what happens in $X$ alone, and $P(Y)$ what is in $Y$ alone. When you predict the decision theory says that you are interested in saying which is the most probable value $y_i$ given some input value $x_i$. So you are interested in finding $P(Y|X)$.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. A joint probability is not always completely described by marginal probabilities. In fact, is completely described only when marginal probabilities are independent. Which means for r.v. $X, Y$ knowing $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ does not put you in position to know the joint density $P(X, Y)$ (thought for independence you have  $P(X,Y)=P(X)P(Y)$). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. From here you can go directly and try to estimate $P(Y|X)$. In fact if your only interest in only in prediction, this might be a fair bet. A lot of supervised learning algorithms tries to estimate directly this probability. They are called discriminant classifiers. The reason is because they are used to classify something to  the class with maximal conditional probability, you discriminate (choose) the maximum value. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Now arriving at your question. Notice the obvious $P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X)$ than you see that by trying learning the joint probability, you also learn the conditional (what you need for prediction). This kind of approach is called generative, because knowing the joint probability you can not only predict, but you can generate new data for your problem. More than that, knowing the join probability can give you more insights related with how what are you model works. You can find such kind of information which is not contained only in marginal distributions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some final notes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Technically you do not minimize the error function, but it's expectation. The error function remains as it is.&#xD;&#xA;- $\mathcal{Z}$ is only a domain it's impossible to describe a probability only by it's domain. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's late, I hope I was not completely incoherent." />

At the end of the day, all the information you have right now is that &quot;GBT did not work well for this prediction problem and this metric&quot;, summed up by a single RMSE comparison. This isn't very much information - it could be that this is a bad dataset for GBT and some &#xD;&#xA;other model would work, it could be that the label can't be predicted from these features with any model, or there could be some error in model setup/validation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd recommend checking the following hypotheses: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Maybe, with your dataset size and the features you have, GBT isn't a very high-performance model. Try something completely different - maybe just a simple linear regression! Or a random forest. Or GBDT with very different parameter settings. Or something else. This will help you diagnose whether it's an issue with choice of models or with something else; if a few very different approaches give you roughly similar results, you'll know that it's not the model choice that is causing these results, and if one of those models behaves differently, then that gives you additional information to help diagnose the issue. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Maybe there's some issue with model setup and validation? I would recommend doing some exploration to get some intuition as to whether the RMSE you're getting is reasonable or whether you should expect better. Your post contained very little detail about what the data actually represents, what you know about the features and labels, etc. Perhaps you know those things but didn't include them here, but if not, you should go back and try to get additional understanding of the data before continuing. Look at some random data points, plot the columns against the target, look at the histograms of your features and labels, that sort of thing. There's no substitute for looking at the data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Maybe there just aren't enough data points to justify complex models. When you have low numbers of data points (&lt; 100), a simpler parametric model built with domain expertise and knowledge of what the features are may very well outperform a nonparametric model.

Therefore, I think that it would be more beneficial to provide some pointers to relevant answers and/or resources. This is exactly what I will do by providing the following information and thoughts of mine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, I should mention the excellent and comprehensive [tutorial on dimensionality reduction](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/150728/FnT_dimensionReduction.pdf) by Burges (2009) from Microsoft Research. He touches on *high-dimensional aspects* of data frequently throughout the monograph. This work, referring to *dimensionality reduction* as *dimension reduction*, presents a theoretical introduction into **the problem**, suggests a **taxonomy** of dimensionality reduction methods, consisting of *projective methods* and *manifold modeling methods*, as well as provides an **overview** of multiple methods in each category.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;**projective** pursuit&quot; methods reviewed include *independent component analysis (ICA)*, *principal component analysis (PCA)* and its variations, such as *kernel PCA* and *probabilistic PCA*, *canonical correlation analysis (CCA)* and its *kernel CCA* variation, *linear discriminant analysis (LDA)*, *kernel dimension reduction (KDR)* and some others. The **manifold** methods reviewed include *multidimensional scaling (MDS)* and its *landmark MDS* variation, *Isomap*, *Locally Linear Embedding* and graphical methods, such as *Laplacian eigenmaps* and *spectral clustering*. I'm listing the most of the reviewed methods here in case, if the original publication is inaccessible for you, either *online* (link above), or *offline* (References).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **caveat** for the term &quot;comprehensive&quot; that I've applied to the above-mentioned work. While it is indeed rather comprehensive, this is relative, as some of the approaches to dimensionality reduction are not discussed in the monograph, in particular, the ones, focused on *unobservable (latent) variables*. Some of them are mentioned, though, with references to another source - a book on dimensionality reduction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I will briefly cover several narrower aspects of the topic in question by referring to my relevant or related answers. In regard to *nearest neighbors (NN)-type approaches* to high-dimensional data, please see my answers [here](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/975/2452) (I especially recommend to check the paper #4 in my list). One of the effects of the *curse of dimensionality* is that high-dimensional data is frequently **sparse**.

Our customers typically uses following monitoring tools to monitor their servers/webapps:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. OpsView&#xD;&#xA; 2. Nagios&#xD;&#xA; 4. Pingdom&#xD;&#xA; 5. Custom shell scripts&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whenever any issue is found, an alert mail comes to our Ops team so that they act upon rectifying the issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As we manage thousands of servers, our Ops teams' inbox is flooded with email alerts all the time. Even a single issue which has a cascading effect, can trigger 20-30 emails.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, what I want to do is to implement a system which will be able to extract important features out of an alert email - like server IP address, type of problem, severity of problem etc. and also classify the emails into proper category, like `CPU-Load-Customer1-Server2, MySQL-Replication-Customer2-DBServer3` etc. We will then have a pre-defined set of debugging steps for each category, in order to help the Ops team to rectify the problem faster. Also, the feature extractor will provide input data to the team for a problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So far I have been able to train *NaiveBayesClassifier* with supervised learning techniques i.e. labeled training data(cluster data), and able to classify new unseen emails into its proper cluster/category. As the emails are based on certain templates, the accuracy of the classifier is very high. But we also get alert emails from custom scripts, which may not follow the templates. So, instead of doing supervised learning, I want to try out unsupervised learning for the same. I am looking into *KMeans clustering*. But again the problem is, we won't know the number of clusters beforehand. **So, which algorithm will be best for this use case?** Right now I am using Python's TextBlob library for classification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, for feature extraction out of an alert email, I am looking into NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html) library. I tried it out, but it seems to work on proper English paragraphs/texts well, however, for alert emails, it extracted a lot of unnecessary features. **Is there already any existing solution for the same?

Note that a closely related term *latent feature* is frequently used within the *machine learning* domain. It seems to me that latent variables resemble what you call &quot;combinations/subsets/segments of the IVs&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By hypothesizing - usually, based on theory or domain knowledge - the **latent structure** of factors, LVM or SEM are able to automatically confirm or decline those hypotheses. This is done by using a combination of *exploratory factor analysis (EFA)* and *confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)* (see [my answer]() ). While EFA is frequently performed independently (and maybe that's enough for your purposes), doing it along with CFA represents a large part of LVM/SEM methodology, which is usually completed by performing *path analysis*, which is concerned about relationships between latent variables.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The `R` *ecosystem* offers a variety of **packages** for performing LVM/SEM in its entirety or for performing EFA, CFA and path analysis. The most popular ones for EFA are `psych`, `GPArotation` and `Hmisc`.

This talks about increasing the accuracy of candidate pair selection by Amplifying a Locality-Sensitive Family. I think I just about understand the mathematical explanation, but I'm struggling to see how I implement this practically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I have so far is as follows&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. I have say 1000 movies each with ratings from some selection of 1M users. Each movie is represented by a sparse vector of user scores (row number = user ID, value = user's score)&#xD;&#xA;1. I build N random vectors. The vector length matches the length of the movie vectors (i.e. the number of users). The vector values are +1 or -1. I actually encode these vectors as binary to save space, with +1 mapped to 1 and -1 mapped to 0&#xD;&#xA;1. I build sketch vectors for each movie by taking the dot product of the movie and each of the N random vectors (or rather, if I create a matrix R by laying the N random vectors horizontally and layering them on top of each other then the sketch for movie m is R*m), then taking the sign of each element in the resulting vector, so I end with a sketch vector for each movie of +1s and -1s, which again I encode as binary. Each vector is length N bits.&#xD;&#xA;1. Next I look for similar sketches by doing the following&#xD;&#xA;  1. I split the sketch vector into b bands of r bits&#xD;&#xA;  1. Each band of r bits is a number. I combine that number with the band number and add the movie to a hash bucket under that number. Each movie can be added to more than one bucket.&#xD;&#xA;  1. I then look in each bucket. Any movies that are in the same bucket are candidate pairs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Comparing this to 3.6.3 of mmds, my AND step is when I look at bands of r bits - a pair of movies pass the AND step if the r bits have the same value. My OR step happens in the buckets: movies are candidate pairs if they are both in any of the buckets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The book suggests I can &quot;amplify&quot; my results by adding more AND and OR steps, but I'm at a loss for how to do this practically as the explanation of the construction process for further layers is in terms of checking pairwise equality rather than coming up with bucket numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can anyone help me understand how to do this?" />

If you use the entire data set to establish the priors (including the 10% of validation data), then yes, it is &quot;cheating&quot; since each of the 10 subset models uses information from the corresponding validation set (i.e., it is not truly a blind test).

Normally, with k-fold cross-validation, there would be one fold where the outlier is in the validation data and not the training data. When applying the corresponding classifier to the outlier during validation, it would likely perform poorly.

In particular, it means that &quot;Spark can create distributed datasets from any storage source supported by Hadoop, including your local file system, HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, Amazon S3, etc.&quot;[1]. For most common data sources (like HDFS or S3) Spark automatically recognizes schema, e.g.: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    val sc = SparkContext(...)&#xD;&#xA;    val localRDD = sc.textFile(&quot;file://...&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;    val hdfsRDD  = sc.textFile(&quot;hdfs://...&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;    val s3RDD    = sc.textFile(&quot;s3://...&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more complicated cases you may need to work with lower-level functions like `newAPIHadoopFile`: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    val hBaseRDD = sc.newAPIHadoopRDD(conf, classOf[TableInputFormat], &#xD;&#xA;          classOf[org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.ImmutableBytesWritable],&#xD;&#xA;          classOf[org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Result])&#xD;&#xA;    val customRDD = sc.newAPIHadoopRDD(conf, classOf[MyCustomInputFormat], &#xD;&#xA;          classOf[MyCustomKeyClass],&#xD;&#xA;          classOf[MyCustomValueClass]) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But general rule is that if some data source is available for MapReduce, it can be easily reused in Spark.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**YARN**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Currently Spark supports 3 cluster managers / modes: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * **Standalone**&#xD;&#xA; * **Mesos**&#xD;&#xA; * **YARN**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Standalone mode uses Spark's own master server and works for Spark only, while YARN and Mesos modes aim to share same set of system resources between several frameworks (e.g. Spark, MapReduce, Impala, etc.).

The Poisson distribution is parameterized by a single value $\lambda$, which describes both the expected value and the variance of the distribution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This results in an approach similar to the one described by Emre in that you are attempting to fit a linear model to the log of your observations.&#xD;&#xA;" />

So, which algorithm will be best for this use case?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you don't know the number of clusters beforehand, it is still possible to do unsupervised learning using a [Dirichlet process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_process) to sample parameters associated to clusters/groups and then cluster your tokens according to those parameters. The general idea is to use a Dirichlet distribution to generate probabilities over words for each cluster and a Dirichlet process uses these probabilities to assign a cluster to each word in your vocabulary. If you want to share clusters between emails, then you use Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes. [Here](http://blog.echen.me/2012/03/20/infinite-mixture-models-with-nonparametric-bayes-and-the-dirichlet-process/) you can find a nice blog post of how this works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most popular library for clustering is [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tut2.html), but notice their warning regarding the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process implementation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;gensim uses a fast, online implementation based on [3]. The HDP model is a new addition to gensim, and still rough around its academic edges – use with care.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for feature extraction, your question doesn't say exactly what kind of unnecessary features you are getting, but if that's the case, you need to filter your tokens before or after processing them with NLTK.

From the original data set remove order_id, use that for prediction and get the results. Now the predicted results have the same order of instances as the copied data set.

This method takes two text corpora as input and you can get the list of words which are being used more in one text corpus over the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically what you need to do is to build a common Term Document Matrix for the corpora you are using and then divide this TDM into two TDMs such that all the document columns from corpus 1 fall in one TDM and all the documents columns form corpus 2 fall in the second TDM.  For example, you have 2 corpora, the first one containing 10 documents and the second one containing 15 documents. You first, combine both these corpora and form 25 document corpus and then form the TDM, where terms become the rows (let's say there are 300 terms) and the 25 documents become the 25 columns. Here the first 10 columns represent the documents of first corpus and the remaining 15 belong to the second corpus. So, you divide this TDM of dimensions `300 x 25` to two TDMs of dimensions `300 x 10` and `300 x 15`. Then you can use `Chi-square difference` over these TDMs to determine which words are occurring more in one corpus than the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A wonderful example has been given regarding this approach by Vik in his blog using Wikileaks corpus and `R` here: http://www.vikparuchuri.com/blog/finding-word-use-patterns-in-wikileaks/" />

First, you can always convert one value you a float.  So `1./2==0.5` and `1/2.==0.5`.

I have a large log of chat sessions between customers and support professionals that I can use. I am wondering what is the best way to go about building this chatbot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some ideas I have looked into;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The first thing I did was to breakdown the chat logs into Q&amp;A pairs. Treat each question as a document, compute a term-document matrix and use it to retrieve the most similar question when a customer asks sometihng. The idea was to then simply pick the answer given to the question by the human (with some modifications). However, this gives really abysmal results and does not match to previous questions very well. Even if I get this approach to work well, we would be limited to the questions that already been asked. &#xD;&#xA; - Another thing I thought about was to modify something like ALICE and write some AIML for customer support related QA. However, that would take a lot of very precise AIML writint to work well. This solution would not be able to scale to other languages, which is something I want to do.&#xD;&#xA; - Another idea I have is to try and cluster the answers given by the customer support staff (they are more likely to be aligned compared to the questions asked by customers). This would give me a sense of what questions are similar. Then I can use something like LSA on the questions and fall back to the first approach.&#xD;&#xA; - Yet another way is to build an ontology of the domain specific knowledge and given a question decide which category the question falls into. The questions from the chat logs can then be mapped to the ontology and I could train classifiers for mapping questions to different knowledge areas. Once I reach the leaf nodes, I can give back pre-defined answers. However, my reservation is that mapping chat logs to the ontology would be very tedious. Is there a good way to map the existing QA to the ontology?" />

In any case, you don't want to do this because even if you were able to get perfect recognition, some of your lines would be placed in the wrong county because tesseract is looking at your document as a big paragraph. I recommend you to use the vertical lines to segment your image into 3 parts and then preprocess each one of them. You can even try to concatenate the parts vertically and perform OCR in a single page. This also applies to the second image.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the way, the resolution of your image is not great, so if you can get a better image, that is going to make a big difference. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For example: http://encore.org, http://idealist.org, http://bridgespan.org, http://cgcareers.org, http://opportunityknocks.org, http://foundationcenter.org, http://thenonprofittimes.com, http://philanthropy.com, http://ynpn.org, http://philanthropyjournal.org, http://nonprofit-jobs.org, [CoF Jobs](http://jobs.cof.org/home/index.cfm?site_id=11690) (section isn't easy to find), http://careers.councilofnonprofits.org, http://nonprofittalentmatch.com.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The fourth way is to perform **Internet search and research** on non-profit or similar organizations that you might be interested in working with (criteria might vary from organization's size to industry focus or geographical locations). Based on the information presented  on their websites, make notes and then approach those organizations, **directly** inquiring or applying for positions of interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The fifth way is to consider various non-profit, for-profit and otherwise social good-themed *data science-focused* **organizations, initiatives and Kaggle-like competitions**, such as [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org), [DrivenData](http://www.drivendata.org), [DataLook](http://datalook.io) and [Data Science for Social Good](http://dssg.io)." />

Therefore, the short answer to your question is that the **first step should be EDA**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This suggestion is supported by most researchers, regardless of their knowledge domain or type of study. Here is how the father of EDA presents his thoughts on the subject (Tukey, 1977, p. 1-3; emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is detective work – numerical&#xD;&#xA;&gt; detective work – or counting detective work – or graphical detective&#xD;&#xA;&gt; work ... unless exploratory data analysis uncovers indications,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; usually quantitative ones, there is likely to be nothing for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; confirmatory data analysis to consider ... [it] can never be the whole&#xD;&#xA;&gt; story, but **nothing else can serve as the foundation stone - as the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; first step**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is an enormous amount of information on approaches, guidelines and procedures for performing EDA. Potential starting points might include [EDA page](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/eda.htm) on the NIST's Engineering Statistics Handbook website, [EDA pages](http://www.epa.gov/caddis/da_exploratory_0.html) on the EPA's website, [corresponding chapter](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~hseltman/309/Book/chapter4.pdf)  from the book &quot;Experimental Design for Behavioral and Social Sciences&quot; and a [survey research paper on EDA](http://cll.stanford.edu/~langley/cogsys/behrens97pm.pdf) by Begrens (1997), among many others. It is interesting to note that some sources include less traditional methods into EDA toolset, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering (for example, see the description of [this research seminar](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i290-eda)). While some of the EDA approaches and methods are relatively simple, overall EDA is both **art and science**, as it [combines unstructured (creative) and structured approaches](http://community.lithium.com/t5/Science-of-Social-blog/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Playing-with-Big-Data/ba-p/71632). This aspect is especially important to recognize, as *big data* exponentially increases complexity of data analyses, including EDA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**References**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Behrens, J. T. (1997). Principles and procedures of exploratory data analysis. *Psychological Methods, 2*(2), 131-160.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tukey, J. W.

However, I've figured that a wider exposure might help the team to fix this and similar problems faster as well as increase the quality of the *machine learning (ML)* engine of their website.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem exposes itself by too many occurrences of a quite trivial *misclassification error* on Amazon's book categories **classification** (which I'm a frequent visitor of). In the following example, the underlying reason of such behavior is quite clear, but in other cases the reasons might be different. I am curious about what could be other potential *reasons* for misclassification and what are the *strategies/approaches* to avoiding such problems. Without much further ado, here's how the problem appears in real life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was reviewing some books, related to transitioning from graduate programs (Ph.D., in particular) to work environment in academia. Among several other books, I ran across the following one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So far, so good. However, let's scroll down a bit further to see the the books ratings in relevant categories. We should expect Amazon to figure out *categories*, **relevant** to the book's *discipline, topic and contents*. How surprised was I (and that's an understatement!) to see the following result of Amazon.com's sophisticated ML engine and algorithms:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clearly, the only fuzzy fact that connects this book with the subject &quot;Audiology and Speech Pathology&quot; (!) is IMHO the author's last name (Boice), which, is **close to** the word &quot;voice&quot;. If my guess is correct, Amazon's ML engine, for some reason, decided to take into account the book's lexicographical attribute instead of the book's most important and **most relevant attributes**, such as title, topic and contents. I've seen multiple occurrences of similar absolutely incorrect ML-based decision making on Amazon.com and some other websites. So, hopefully my question makes sense as well as interesting and important enough to spark a discussion: **What could be other potential reasons for misclassification and what are the strategies/approaches to avoiding such problems?** (Any related thoughts will also be appreciated.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4LSzV.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/KXrFh.png" />

However the representation should give a clear picture of potencies, although high detail accuracy is not required: some sort of classification is adequate. I played with JUNG with a graph having edge weights as the change in potency and the ISOM layout thinking that it reserves (as much as possible) the edge weights but with not good results.

For that, I'm first trying LDA with measures (e.g. Hellinger) on the per document topic distributions. However, to find # of topics for my corpus ( a 948 document dataset, extracted from larger collection, where docs about the same story are humanly annotated), it was suggested to use HDP. Unfortunately, after MANY tries, I'm still unsure I'm using the packages correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More detailed:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) HDPFASTER continually increases the number of topics (in train.log file).  What is the stopping criterion (e.g. difference in avg. likelihood between successive iterations smaller than x? which x?) and/or how many cycles should I let it run? Afterwords, do I take as the correct # of topics the last line of &quot;train.log&quot; OR should I also test for minimum perplexity (It has also been suggested that BIC might be a better measure) and choose the smallest? If the latter, should I test for ALL iterations?!  Is HDPFASTER's test feature the appropriate tool for this? Last, should I --sample_hyper? Do I just use a(alpha) as input to LDA's prior alpha, perhaps divided by a number (e.g. # of topics)? What about LDA's prior beta? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) HCA continually decreases  the number of topics (in *.log file). When to stop? Do I accept the final # of topics in .log ( exp.ent =number0) OR do I search for the minimum perplexity of test set (as I assume it appears as number2 in &quot;log_2(perp)=number1,number2&quot; in .log throughout iterations), which ALWAYS appears VERY close to my initial max number of topics? Hyperparameters alpha,beta: do I sample using -D , -E? Which do I put as input to LDA's priors? Is it generally worth it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Geneally: Is it possible that my dataset is just too small and/or 'biased/fragmented/incomplete', in the sense that each story has only 1-3 examples, while the diversity of the topics these stories discuss can be quite large? Should I just try and augment it with a larger 'homogenous' dataset? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Impurity - being the opposite of purity - is referring to the distribution of the decision categories (or class labels) within the set. Initially, each row in the table is one element and your set of elements are all rows of your table. This set is called pure if it just consists of the same class label and it is called impure if it contains all different class labels in the same proportion. Translating into the values of entropy (remember being an impurity measure, the set has in the latter case the highest possible value and in the former case (just the same class label) the lowest value. The lowest possible value for entropy is 0.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So let's choose a visual respresentation to illustrate what really counts and what does not matter for the entropy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) You start off with the initial table which contains the following class labels:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please note that for computing the entropy none of the remaining attributes, attribute values matter, also the order of the rows don't matter (entropy is a measure for a set of elements)&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;2) You convert the different class labels to different colors&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) So instead of this table with the colored class labeled, you just draw a circle (&quot;ball&quot;) for each class label (=element)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now you throw all the balls in a bag. There you go! Your elements of a set are represented as balls in a bag.  If you open the bag and look into it, you might see &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. just balls of the same color --&gt; one pure color. The entropy says, it's not impure at all, I give it a zero! entropy = 0&#xD;&#xA; 2. the same amount of balls in different colors --&gt; that doesn't look pure at all, it's impure! The entropy assigns the highest possible value to this set (bag). The highest possible entropy value depends on the number of class labels. If you have just two, the maximum entropy is 1. In your case, you have 4 different class labels, so the maximum entropy would be e.g. if you had 12 balls and 3 balls of each color. The maximum entropy of a 4 class set is 2.&#xD;&#xA; 3. none of the above. Then your entropy is between the two values. If one color is dominant then the entropy will be close to 0, if the colors are very mixed up, then it is close to the maximum (2 in your case).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How does a decision tree use the entropy:&#xD;&#xA;Well, first you calculate the entropy of the whole set. That impurity if your reference. What your decision tries to achieve is to reduce the impurity of the whole set. So the information Gain for a given attribute is computed by taking the entropy of the whole set and subtracting it with the entropies of sets that are obtained by breaking the whole set into one piece per attribute category. To make sure a set with just a few elements don't get the same weight as a set with many elements the entropies of sets are multiplied by their relative frequency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coming back to the example, for computing the Gain (S, parents) you need to compute the weighted entropies of the two sets: set 1 = all rows with category(parent) = yes and set 2 = all rows with category(parent) = no).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Set 1 refers to five rows, all having the decision category = cinema(just 5 orange balls!)&#xD;&#xA;So the weight is 5 rows out of 10 rows = 5/10 = 0.5. And the entropy is 0 (totally pure) or by applying the formula:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have a sum over all class labels so n = 4. So you assign a class label to each of the i's. E.g.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 1 being cinema: - (5/5 * log(3/3) = - (1 * log(1)) = - (1*0) = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 2 being tennis: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 3 being stay in: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 4 being shopping: - (0/5 * log(0/3) = - (0 * log(0)) = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the sum of all four is 0. 0 times the weight 0.5 equals 0.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Set 2 also refers to five rows, having the decision categories = 1*cinema, 2*tennis, 1*stay in, 1*shopping&#xD;&#xA;So the weight is also 5 rows out of 10 rows = 5/10 = 0.5. Applying the formula:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 1 being cinema: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 2 being tennis: - (2/5 * log(2/5) = - (0.4 * -1,32) = 0.53&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 3 being stay in: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For i = 4 being shopping: - (1/5 * log(1/5) = - (0.2 * -2,32) = 0.46&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the sum of all four is 1.92. 1.92 times the weight 0.5 = 0.96.&#xD;&#xA;Thus, the Gain for this attribute is: &#xD;&#xA;Initial entropy - weighted entropies for all attribute categories:&#xD;&#xA;1.57 - 0 - 0.96 = 0.61.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the other attributes you do the same calculation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CbjbT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/A4mux.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ufvDS.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/dDMBf.jpg" />

Suppose you have a data set which you split in two, test and training.  An overfitted model is one that performs much worse on the test dataset than on training dataset.  It is often observed that models like that also in general perform worse on additional (new) test datasets than models which are not overfitted.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way to understand that intuitively is that a model may use some relevant parts of the data (signal) and some irrelevant parts (noise).  An overfitted model uses more of the noise, which increases its performance in the case of known noise (training data) and decreases its performance in the case of novel noise (test data).  The difference in performance between training and test data indicates how much noise the model picks up; and picking up noise directly translates into worse performance on test data (including future data).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Summary: overfitting is bad by definition, this has not much to do with either complexity or ability to generalize, but rather has to do with mistaking noise for signal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. On the &quot;ability to generalize&quot; part of the question, it is very possible to have a model which has inherently limited ability to generalize due to the structure of the model (for example linear SVM, ...) but is still prone to overfitting.  In a sense overfitting is just one way that generalization may fail." />

For that, I'm first trying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with divergences (Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon) on the per document topic distributions. However, to find # of topics for my corpus ( a 948 document dataset, extracted from larger collection, where docs about the same story are humanly annotated), it was suggested to use HDP. Unfortunately, after MANY tries, I'm still unsure I'm using the packages correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More detailed:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) HDPFASTER continually increases the number of topics (in train.log file).  What is the stopping criterion (e.g. difference in avg. likelihood between successive iterations smaller than x? which x?) and/or how many cycles should I let it run? Afterwords, do I take as the correct # of topics the last line of &quot;train.log&quot; OR should I also test for minimum perplexity (It has also been suggested that Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) might be a better measure) and choose the smallest? If the latter, should I test for ALL iterations?!  Is HDPFASTER's test feature the appropriate tool for this? Last, should I --sample_hyper? Do I just use a(alpha) as input to LDA's prior alpha, perhaps divided by a number (e.g. # of topics)? What about LDA's prior beta? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) HCA continually decreases  the number of topics (in *.log file). When to stop? Do I accept the final # of topics in .log ( exp.ent =number0) OR do I search for the minimum perplexity of test set (as I assume it appears as number2 in &quot;log_2(perp)=number1,number2&quot; in .log throughout iterations), which ALWAYS appears VERY close to my initial max number of topics? Hyperparameters alpha,beta: do I sample using -D , -E? Which do I put as input to LDA's priors? Is it generally worth it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally: Is it possible that my dataset is just too small and/or 'biased/fragmented/incomplete', in the sense that each story has only 1-3 examples, while the diversity of the topics these stories discuss can be quite large?

When deciding which one to use, try to think of a few representative cases and work out which index would give the most usable results to achieve your objective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if you have two objects both with 10 attributes, out of a possible 100 attributes. Further they have all 10 attributes in common. In this case, the Jaccard index will be 1 and the cosine index will be 0.001. Now consider another scenario where object A has 10 attributes, and object B has 50 attributes, but B has all 10 attributes that A has. Here, Jaccard index will be 0.2 and cosine index will still be 0.001. So the key question is if that extra bit of information reflected, in this case, in the Jaccard index useful or does it hurt or does it not matter. Your choice will depend on which is the best solution for your problem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Cosine index could be used to identify plagiarism, but will not be a good index to identify mirror sites on the internet. Whereas the Jaccard index, will be a good index to identify mirror sites, but not so great at catching copy pasta plagiarism (within a larger document). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, these are toy examples to illustrate a point. When applying these indices, you must think about your problem thoroughly and figure out how to define similarity. Once you have a definition in mind, you can go about shopping for an index.    " />

Essentially the harder the problem, the more capable and advanced tools need to be used to solve it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There will be two major stages in this task: digitizing the data (image to text, i.e. OCR) and processing the data (performing the actual count). Look at them separately in order to select the best method for each stage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main challenges in these images and generic OCR are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;a) images have low resolution. For example the # 1 image has resolution of about 72 dpi. Suggested resolution for such text quality is to scan at 300 to 400 dpi, but it is clear that re-scanning or controlling scan resolution is not applicable now. That’s why one option is to clean and increase the size using image pre-processing tools. This is what the original #1 image snippet looks like after adaptive binarization and zoomed at 300%. It is clear that each character has too few pixels and characters can be easily misread.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;b) GIF format in #1 is not supported by many OCR applications. Images need to be batch-converted to a different format, such as PNG or TIF.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;c) in these scans the backgrounds and bleed-through (shadow from the text on the other side of the paper) is visible. Good binarization needs to be used to remove background and bleed-through, but not remove vital parts of actual characters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After implementing specific pre-processing solutions for the items listed above, and then using a high quality OCR system, such as www.ocr-it.com API, highest possible results can be achieved.  Result is far from perfect, but it is as high accuracy as it could be achieved with a modern OCR engine on these images.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Luckily for this project, the data needs to be counted, so the second stage has all necessary data for reliable data post-processing analysis. Contrary to other basic OCR engines, the OCR provided by [www.ocr-it.com][3] API, which I used to produce the above recognition.  OCR-IT API is free to develop with, and very inexpensive to use per page, so that may be a very economical but powerful solution for this project.  It returns formatted text layout, including preserving line breaks and overall format structure.  This makes text post-processing easier.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A simple algorithm can be run to count the number of lines, resulting in the necessary for the research count.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The above describes a two-stage approach: getting best possible OCR result, and using an applicable method to process data for the required task&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bat wait, there is more…&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a second option to use an even more specialized OCR application called [FlexiCapture][4] with FlexiLayout technology.  This powerful and intelligent data capture technology has built-in high-accuracy OCR, and it has a powerful rules and data analytics engine to perform very specialized user-defined chains of actions and tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The implementation of this method using FlexiCapture with FlexiLayout takes the following logical steps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, full page OCR is performed and all objects are extracted, including characters, noise, black horizontal and vertical lines, white gaps, and objects (which could be pictures, logos, handwriting, etc.).  This produces objects upon which we can apply our search criteria.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next, the following constraints are applied to the post-OCR data analysis and search criteria: separate image into three vertical columns and run the following logic per column, use line-start as individual count, skip header/footer/indented lines (county names), assume each name to have at least three characters, find recursively every name starting from top to bottom in every column, exclude previously found lines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the above logic sounds complex to setup, the actual setup takes just a few minutes and requires minimal work through user interface (UI) environment.  No coding or programming is necessary.   The following search elements and criteria have been created.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;RepeatingGroup consisting of a CharacterString search object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This setup produces the following search result for the first column of data:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the last step, FlexiCapture is instructed to return the number of total found elements that fit our search criteria, effectively producing the necessary data for the research task.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are other logic alternatives that can be setup in FlexiCapture, such as finding the number of white spaces between lines, or searching for the fixed-length fixed-placement 3-letter combinations at the end of every column linen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In conclusion, there are several options (which is always nice) how this task can be achieved with relative ease in effort and high quality, but the success depends on the quality of tools used and necessary knowledge how to use them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you believe some of these tools and processes can be beneficial to your project, please contact my directly.

The aim of the Kaggle's Titanic problem is to build a **classification** system that is able to predict one outcome (whether one person survived or not) given some input data. The survival table is a **training dataset**, that is, a table containing a set of examples to train your system with. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned before, you could apply Naive Bayes to build your classification system to solve the Titanic problem. Naive Bayes is one of the simplest classification algorithms out there. It assumes that the data in your dataset has a very specific structure. Sometimes Naive Bayes can provide you with results that are good enough. Even if that is not the case, Naive Bayes may be useful as a first step; the information you obtain by analyzing Naive Bayes' results, and by further data analysis, will help you to choose which classification algorithm you could try next. Other examples of classification methods are k-nearest neighbours, neural networks, and logistic regression, but this is just a short list. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are new to Machine Learning, I recommend you to take a look to this course from Stanford: https://www.coursera.org/course/ml" />

The only thing you need to remember is that likelihood refers to the probability of your data given a parameter. That is,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;$$L(\theta| X) = P(X|\theta)$$&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, the likelihood focuses on the parameter, so you're asking &quot;What is the likelihood of this parameter given some observations?&quot; In this case, the phrase &quot;given some observation&quot; assumes the observations $X$ are fixed and the parameter $\theta$ is not fixed. On the other hand, if you describe the same in terms of probability, you're trying to measure the probability of some observations $X$ given a fixed parameter $\theta$. It is only a matter of usage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of logistic regression, the likelihood function is described as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;$$L(\beta| y) = \prod_{i}^{N} \frac{n_{i}}{n_{i}!(n_{i}-y_{i})!}\pi_{i}^{n_{i}}(1-\pi_{i})^{n_{i} - y_{i}}$$&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;where $\beta$ is the vector of parameters $\{\pi_{i}| i=1,...,N \}$and $y$ is the vector of observed counts. As you can see, this is the same (by definition) as $P(y|\beta)$ and that is what you have in the equation above: The product of the probabilities for each observation $y_{i}$ given its parameter $\pi_{i}$. As usual, each probability $\pi_{i}$ is equal to the logistic regression equation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Naive Bayes, you have the same basic idea. The likelihood is defined as $L(p_{k}|x) = \prod_{i}^{N}p_{ki}^{x_{i}}(1-p_{ki})^{(1-x_{i})}$ where $p_{k}$ is a vector of parameters describing the probabilities of a class $k$ generating a word $x_{i}$).&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;In the EM algorithm, the likelihood is again $L(\theta|X,Z)$, where $\theta$ are your parameters, $X$ your observations and $Z$ are latent variables. The fact that you have a latent variables shouldn't confuse you, because this variable will be &quot;integrated out&quot;  in the expectation step of the algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the previous equations, the calculation you need to do is self-evident if you think about it starting from your observations: First, I have some observations. Then I want to calculate the probability of obtaining these observation using some model. Most models require parameters to be fitted. So I want to calculate the probability of these observations given those parameters. That is, $p(X|\theta)$. Now, if you need to talk about likeliihood, then you simply write $L(\theta|X)$." />

Essentially, it would be a simple look-up table.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You tell the model what attributes each piece of data has and it simply remembers it and does nothing more with it. If you give it a piece of data that it's seen before, it looks it up and simply regurgitates what you told it earlier. If you give it data it *hasn't* seen before, the outcome is unpredictable or random. But the point of machine learning isn't to tell you what happened, it's to understand the patterns and use those patterns to predict what's going on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So think of a decision tree. If you keep growing your decision tree bigger and bigger, eventually you'll wind up with a tree in which every leaf node is based on exactly one data point. You've just found a backdoor way of creating a look-up table.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to generalize your results to figure out what might happen in the future, you must create a model that generalizes what's going on in your training set. Overfit models do a great job of describing the data you already have, but descriptive models are not necessarily predictive models.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The No Free Lunch Theorem says that no model can outperform any other model on the set of all *possible* instances. If you want to predict what will come next in the sequence of numbers &quot;2, 4, 16, 32&quot; you can't build a model more accurate than any other if you don't make the assumption that there's an underlying pattern. A model that's overfit isn't really evaluating the patterns - it's simply modeling what it knows is possible and giving you the observations. You get predictive power by assuming that there is some underlying function and that if you can determine what that function is, you can predict the outcome of events. But if there really is no pattern, then you're out of luck and all you can hope for is a look-up table to tell you what you know is possible." />

Order matters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;L1: {P1=(S,S,S)}, {P2=(B,B,S)}, {P3=(B,B,S,S)}, ... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My friend goes to a baseball game and does the same thing.  Later, we meet up and compare our lists.  We find that our lists are almost identical except that I recorded a strike for player 16 where my friend recorded a ball.  What are the chances we were at the same game and one of us made a mistake at player 16?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks in advance..." />

So in this case a Linear SVM or Logistic Regression, preferably with an algorithm implementation that can take advantage of sparsity due to the size of the data. It will take a long time to run a DL algorithm on that dataset, and I would only normally try deep learning on specialist problems where there's some hierarchical structure in the data, such as images or text. It's overkill for a lot of simpler learning problems, and takes a lot of time and expertise to learn and also DL algorithms are very slow to train. Additionally, just because you have 50M rows, doesn't mean you need to use the entire dataset to get good results. Depending on the data, you may get good results with a sample of a few 100,000 rows or a few million. I would start simple, with a small sample and a linear classifier, and get more complicated from there if the results are not satisfactory. At least that way you'll get a baseline.

GBT is a good method especially if you have mixed feature types like categorical, numerical and such. In addition, compared to Neural Networks it has lower number of hyperparameters to be tuned. Therefore, it is faster to have a best setting model. One more thing is the alternative of parallel training. You can train multiple trees at the same time with a good CPU. If you are not satisfied with the results then go for Neural Nets since that means your model should be more extensive and should learn higher order information through your data.

Considering the case when you have to classify an observation (instance) whih is identical with one observation from the 'learned' data set, than the inverse distance is not defined by a direct formula since you have to divide by zero. But considering the math behind, inverse of the zero distance is positive infinity. Which means that, the weight for the identical point would dominate all other weights of the data instances. Thus the classification for that specific point could be taken as the class of the identical observation from the data set. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand the inverse of the euclidean distance is only one type of distance.

DropBox has the advantage that it does do at least some primitive logging and version control and manages the servers for you, but the disadvantage that it's a commercial service, you have to pay for large storage, and you're putting your unpublished data on a commercial storage; you don't have to pay much, though, so it's a viable option.  Bittorrent Sync has a very similar interface, but you run it yourself on your own storage servers and it doesn't have any version control.

My reasoning would be that, before you move things to a server, you can move a great deal forward by being able to test several different versions in the local environment mentioned above.  Examples of VCS are [git](http://git-scm.com), [svn](https://subversion.apache.org), and for the deep nerds, [darcs](http://darcs.net).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, a &quot;Python server&quot; where you can deploy your software once it is integrated into a releasable version is something usually called &quot;[staging server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_site)&quot;.  There is a whole philosophy in software engineering &amp;mdash; [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) &amp;mdash; that advocates staging whatever you have in VCS daily or even on each change.  In the end, this means that some automated program, running on the staging server, checks out your code, sees that it compiles, runs all defined tests and maybe outputs a package with a version number.  Examples of such programs are [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org), [Buildbot](http://buildbot.net) (this one is Python-specific), and [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/recent) (for cloud-hosted projects).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What are the hardware requirements for such a box?** None, as far as I can tell.  Whenever it runs out of disk space, you will have to clean up.  Having more CPU speed and memory will make concurrent builds easier, but there is no real minimum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Do I need to be concerned about any specific packages or conflicts between projects?**  Yes, this has been identified as a problem, not only in Python, but in many other systems (see [Dependency hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell)).  The established practice is to keep projects isolated from each other as far as their dependencies are concerned.  This means, avoid installing dependencies on the system Python interpreter, even locally; always define a [virtual environment](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and install dependencies there.  Many of the aforementioned CI servers will do that for you anyway." />

Trying to list some criteria that seem objective to me:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- the important advantage of Python is that it is a general-purpose language.  If you will need to do anything else than statistics with your program (generate a web interface, integrate it with a reporting system, pass it on to other developers for maintenance) you are far better off with Python.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- the important advantage of R is that it is a specialized language.  If you already know that there is a technique you want to use, and it is not a usual suspect (like NN), then you probably will find a library in CRAN that makes life easier for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And here is another, more subjective advice:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- both languages are not really performance-oriented.  If you need to process large quantities of data, or process very fast, or process in parallel, you will run into trouble ... but it is far easier to run into such trouble with R than with Python.  In my experience, you find the limits of R within some weeks, and the way to push them is quite arcane; while you can use Python for years, never really missing the speed that C developers always mention as the Holy Grail, and even when you do, you can use Cython to make up for the difference.  The only real trouble is concurrency, but for statistics, it is hardly ever an issue." />

Topics that you should have a firm grasp on include regression, correlation, hypothesis testing and the bias-variance tradeoff. You don't have to go into too much theoretical depth into any of these topics but you should know what these are before you start studying machine learning. Your study in machine learning should include developing an understanding of hypothesis spaces, Bayesian analysis (can you explain the difference between MLE, MAP and optimal Bayes?), Expectation Maximization, logistic regression, clustering (especially k-means), max-margin classifiers (SVMs), overfitting (can you explain what it is in terms of bias and variance?) and feature selection. Linear algebra is helpful but can be done without in many cases.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As someone who does research in data mining and has worked closely with several companies, I can tell you that if you seriously want to go into machine learning, it is NOT enough to simply know how to code something using Weka or R. Those are easy enough to use once you know the concepts. When companies hire data scientists, they want someone who can take the raw data and do something useful with it. A good grasp of fundamentals is obviously essential, since each company's data has its own quirks (and will typically be too big for you to try 'everything'). Good luck!" />

For example in R you would use factors, in weka you would use nominal variables. This is not the care in scikit learn. The decision trees implemented in sklearn uses only numerical features and these features are interpreted always as continuous numeric variables. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, simply replacing the strings with a hash code should be avoided, because being considered as a continuous numerical feature any coding you will use will induce an order which simply does not exists in your data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One example is to code ['red','green','blue'] with [1,2,3], would produce weird things like 'red' is lower than 'blue', and if you average a 'red' and a 'blue' you will get a 'green'. Another more sublte example maigh happen when you code ['low', 'medium', 'high'] with [1,2,3]. In the latter case it might happen to have an ordering which makes sense, however some sublte inconsistencies might happen when 'medium' in not in the middle of 'low' and 'high'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally the answer to your question lies in coding the categorical feature into multiple binary features. For example you might code ['red','green','blue'] with 3 columns, one for each category, having 1 when the category match and 0 otherwise. This is called one-hot-encoding, binary encoding, one-of-k-encoding or whatever. You can check documentation here for [encoding categorical features][1] and [feature extraction - hashing and dicts][2]. Obviously one-hot-encoding will expand your space requirements and sometimes it hurts the performance as well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#dict-feature-extraction" />

Giving more detail would probably lead to a much better answer; especially as it's a little unusual to approach selection of classification algorithms on the basis of the programming paradigm with which they're associated. If your real world example is confidential, then simply make up a fictional-but-analogous example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***Big Data Classification without ILP***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, after ruling out ILP we have 4 other logic programming paradigms in our consideration set:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

Functional&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;in addition to the dozens of paradigms and sub-paradigms outside of logic programming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Within *Functional Logic Programming* for instance,  there exists extensions of ILP called *Inductive Functional Logic Programming*, which is based on inversion narrowing (i.e. inversion of the narrowing mechanism). This approach overcomes several limitations of ILP and ([according to some scholars, at least][1]) is as suitable for application in terms of representation and has the benefit of allowing problems to be expressed in a more natural way. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without knowing more about the specifics of your database and the barriers you face to using ILP, I can't know if this solves your problem or suffers from the same problems. As such, I'll throw out a completely different approach as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[ILP is contrasted with &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;propositional&quot; approaches to data mining][2]. Those approaches include the meat and bones of Machine Learning like decision trees, neural networks, regression, bagging and other statistical methods. Rather than give up on these approaches due to the size of your data, you can join the ranks of many Data Scientists, Big Data engineers and statisticians who utilize High Performance Computing (HPC) to employ these methods on with massive data sets (there are also sampling and other statistical techniques you may choose to utilize to reduce the computational resources and time required to analyze the Big Data in your relational database). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;HPC includes things like utilizing multiple CPU cores, scaling up your analysis with elastic use of servers with high memory and large numbers of fast CPU cores, using high-performance data warehouse appliances, employing clusters or other forms of parallel computing, etc. I'm not sure what language or statistical suite you're analyzing your data with, but as an example this [CRAN Task View][3] lists many HPC resources for the R language which would allow you to scale up a propositional algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.225.4755&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xzVD8C2YpnQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Predictive%20Data-Mining.%20A%20Practical%20Guide.%20&amp;ots=IN48sFFcSQ&amp;sig=d6TOKBx_6qmitB8BSTk4_nLO9ak&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html" />

Having said that, software tools like Tableau might be good enough to perform initial phase of data science **workflow**: *exploratory data analysis (EDA)*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of data science **self-education**, there are several popular online courses (MOOCs) that you can choose from (most come in both free and paid versions). In addition to the one on Udacity that you've mentioned (https://www.udacity.com/course/ud359), there are two data science courses on Coursera: *Introduction to Data Science* by University of Washington (https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci) and a set of courses from *Data Science specialization* by Johns Hopkins University (https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1).

There are several other, albeit less popular, data science MOOCs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of **data sources**, I'm not sure what do you mean by &quot;Dummy Data&quot;, but there is a wealth of *open data sets*, including many in the area of *public health*. You can review corresponding resources, listed on KDnuggets (http://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html) and choose ones that you're interested in. For a country-level analysis, the fastest way to obtain data is finding and visiting corresponding *open data* government websites. For example, for public health data in US, I would go to http://www.healthdata.gov and http://www.data.gov (the latter - for corresponding non-medical data that you might want to include in your analysis).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In regard to **research papers** in the area of public health, I have two comments: 1) most *empirical research* in that (or any other) area IMHO can be considered a data science study/project; 2) you need to perform a *literature review* in the area or on the topic of your interest, so you're on your own in that sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, a note on **software tools**. If you're serious about data science, I would suggest to invest some time in learning either R, or Python (if you don't know them already), as those are two most popular open source tools among data scientists nowadays.

Actually, if *every* N gets scheduled and the only question is which M it gets, the outputs are lists which channel (or none) is scheduled to each block, and there is only a certain possible number of those, so you can model them as discrete outputs (classes) with their own probabilities.

Also, don't make the mistake of using the serial number in your machine learning algorithms! The reason why I'm suggesting regression as opposed to 'better' machine learning algorithms is because you said you wanted to learn, and it's important to understand the algorithms (for the long run, and to truly be good at this stuff) that you're using. Regression is the easiest tool in the book that works quite well! Weka is so easy to use that you'll be able to plug and play different machine learning algorithms just for the sake of it. Another pointer that's won me several competitions is to do some feature selection before using regression/machine learning. For example, in your case, it is reasonable to assume that a student who scores high in Physics probably has a better chance of scoring high in Math as opposed to someone who scores high in English (but not necessarily Physics). If you have enough data, the algorithm itself will be able to deduce these positive/negative correlations and train the model accordingly. Sometimes, there isn't enough data, and you have to do some feature selection. Good luck! I'm a regular participant on Kaggle myself, and I think it's great that you're taking the 'hacker' route to learn more.

This is largely due to the combination of language features (call-by-value, extreme dynamism, lazy evaluation) and the lack of efficient built-in types.

That same model would also predict if&#xD;&#xA;the opponent of that team will win, draw, or loose the match. Each model predicting with an accuracy of about 50% on each team distinctively. The second set of models I tried, takes the combination of data from both teams and predicts which class the match belongs to (home win, away win, draw). In the system,&#xD;&#xA;only 10 matches are given everyday to be predicted. Meaning, if I predict the 10 matches using the second model, I have a chance of predicting 5 &#xD;&#xA;correctly. In this project, I only need to predict 3 matches correctly out of the 10 matches given in a day. Is there a system&#xD;&#xA;of knowing the 3 matches which my models have the best chance of predicting correctly?

Reinforcement Learning is not limited to discrete spaces. But most of the introductory literature does deal with discrete spaces.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you might know by now that there are three important components in any Reinforcement Learning problem: Rewards, States and Actions. The first is a scalar quantity and theoretically the latter two can either be discrete or continuous. The convergence proofs and analyses of the various algorithms are easier to understand for the discrete case and also the corresponding algorithms are easier to code. That is one of the reasons, most introductory material focuses on them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, it should be interesting to note that the early research on Reinforcement Learning actually focussed on continuous state representations. It was only in the the 90s since the literature started representing all the standard algorithms for discrete spaces as we had a lot of proofs for them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if you noticed carefully, I said continuous states only. Mapping continuous states and continuous actions is hard. Nevertheless, we do have some solutions for now.

If I use RGB, and I do not care much as to how human eye perceives colors, then D21 can be the \ell_2 norm of the difference [1, 1, 1] - [1, 0.05, 0.7].

So, as long as you preserve orde, the decision trees are the same (obviously by the same tree here I understand the same decision structure, not the same values for each test in each node of the tree). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason why it happens is because how usual impurity functions works. In order to find the best split it searches on each dimension (attribute) a split point which is basically an if clause which groups target values corresponding to instances which has test value less than split value, and on the right the values greater than equal. This happens for numerical attributes (which I think is your case because I do not know how to normalize a nominal attribute). Now you might note that the criteria is less than or greater than. Which means that the real information from the attributes in order to find the split (and the whole tree) is only the order of the values. Which means that as long as you transform your attributes in such a way that the original ordering is reserved, you will get the same tree. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all models are insensitive to such kind of transformation. For example linear regression models give the same results if you multiply an attribute with something different than zero. You will get different regression coefficients, but the predicted value will be the same. This is not the case when you take a log of that transformation. So for linear regression, for example, normalizing is useless since it will provide the same result. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However this is not the case with a penalized linear regression, like ridge regression. In penalized linear regressions a constraint is applied to coefficients. The idea is that the constraint is applied to the sum  of a function of coefficients. Now if you inflate an attribute, the coefficient will be deflated, which means that in the end the penalization for that coefficient it will be artificially modified. In such kind of situation, you normalize attributes in order that each coefficient to be constraint 'fairly'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope it helps" />

If you denote $F$ to be the sum of all column sums (or, alternatively, the total capacity of all sources), then your problem narrows down to finding a max-flow from $L$ to $R$ in $BP$ and checking whether the volume of the discovered flow equals $F$.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Note 1 (Feasibility):* Before plunging into finding best flows, you may want to check your row sums: a necessary condition for your problem to have a solution is that the sum of all column sums (which is $N$ in your particular case of a column-stochastic matrix) should be equal the sum of row sums, as both numbers describe the same -- the sum of all elements of the target matrix. (For example, for $N = 3$ and the vector of row sums from your example, the problem is unfeasible.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Note 2 (Upper bound):* Since $a_{ij}$ describes the flow from $j$'th source, and the capacities of all sources are 1 in your setting, then each source cannot send more than 1 unit of mass to a single destination. Thus, each $a_{ij}$ will not exceed 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Note 3 (Lower bound):* To make $a_{ij}$ for each existing edge $(j \to i)$ strictly positive, you can augment the max-flow problem with lower bounds on edge capacities. In a general setting, edge capacity bounds are $0$ and $+\infty$. You may want to replace the lower bound with some positive number, small enough not to interfere with the discovery of the best flow and large enough to satisfy your edge saturation needs." />

If $M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ (or $\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$) is a [diagonizable matrix][1], it has an [eigendecomposition][2]&#xD;&#xA;\begin{equation}&#xD;&#xA;M = V\Delta V^{-1}&#xD;&#xA;\textrm{,}&#xD;&#xA;\end{equation}&#xD;&#xA;with $V:=\begin{bmatrix}v_{1},v_{2},\ldots,v_{n}\end{bmatrix}$ the matrix with its $n$ eigenvectors $v_{i}$ as columns and $\Delta:=\operatorname{diag}\left(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots,\lambda_{n}\right)$ the diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues on its main diagonal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see from this equation if you want to get matrices with the same eigenvectors, i.e. $V$ fixed, you can only change the eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$. In general the relationship between the eigenvalues and the entries of the original matrix $M$ is non-trivial. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The easiest situation arises if the eigenvectors $v_{i}$ form the standard basis, i.e. only $1$ at the $i$th position, $0$ otherwise. Then $M=I\Delta I^{-1}=\Delta$ ($I$ the identity matrix) and you can change every entry on the main diagonal without changing any eigenvector. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix" />

The collection is initially unlabelled, but labels can be added using an expensive operation (for example, by human).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Currently I use the simple generic machine learning strategy:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Use hand-crafted rules to select a smaller subset of objects (thus leaving out a fraction of interesting ones).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Label part of the smaller subset, and use these for training and choosing a classification algorithm and its parameters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Classify the remaining objects in the smaller set (and also perhaps in the big set).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has two drawbacks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The labeller still needs to see a huge number of uninteresting objects, and therefore is able to label only a very small fraction of interesting ones. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. The objects not in the smaller set are completely ignored in the learning phase, resulting in a loss of some information (the classification algorithm might not work well on this complement).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems that it would be better to use online learning: i.e., select the objects to show to the labeller based on the previous labels. But then it becomes no longer obvious that the result of classification algorithm retains the nice theoretical properties (i.e., statistical consistency).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there a general framework for active object detection which works either theoretically or practically (or both)?
