    // Exercise (hard): As written the output data has an important limitation
    //   for use in a search engine. Really common words, like "a", "an", "the",
    //   etc. are pervasive. There are two tools to improve this. One is to
    //   filter out so-called "stop" words that aren't useful for the index.
    //   The second is to use a variation of this algorithm called "term
    //   frequency-inverse document frequency" (TF-IDF). Look up this algorithm
    //   and implement it.
