/**

Filtering (“Grepping”), Parsing, and Validation
===============================================

Problem Statement:
------------------
  There is a set of records and it is required to collect all records that meet some condition or
transform each record (independently from other records) into another representation. The later case includes such
tasks as text parsing and value extraction, conversion from one format to another.
Solution: Solution is absolutely straightforward – Mapper takes records one by one and emits accepted items or their
transformed versions.

Applications:
------------
  Log Analysis, Data Querying, ETL, Data Validation
