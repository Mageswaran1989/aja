(0006.2001-02-08.kitchen.ham.txt,Subject: california power 2 / 8 please contact kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) or robert johnston ( x 39934 ) for further clarification . executive summary : utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles - agreement on payback for the bailout , rate increases , and further short - term funding for dwr purchases of power . disagreement persists between gov . davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities . the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets . the economics of the long - term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period . air quality management district regulations are under review , but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity . legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left - wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow , if not stop , davis ' s bailout and rate hike plans . senator burton ' s eminent domain threats against generators , which reflect this pressure , are of little significance . 1 . bankruptcy outlook rising once again a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state , the utilities , and their creditors , with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday . socal edison and pg & e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll . they are working very hard to keep cash on - hand , and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing . once this filing occurs , they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy . opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy . assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely , but that everything will be resolved during that 50 - day period . senator john burton " is in no hurry " to reach a deal with the utilities , as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to " strong - arm " the utilities . burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy . the senator stated , " bankruptcy would be bad , but not the worst thing possible . " he intends to stick to his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis ' end - of - week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities . still , bankruptcy can be avoided if a last - minute deal can be struck monday on : what the state receives in return for the bailout the scope of rate hikes ( a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e / socal v . cpuc rate undercollection case monday ) additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may . there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance . however , the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high - level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend . additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature . the non - energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk , as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund . 2 . state to take 2 / 3 of utility debt while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $ 12 billion debt , a final deal has been held up on two fronts . first , it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt . it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and / or transmission assets . a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets . the value of these assets still has not been settled . second , while the state will be on the hook for $ 9 billion , it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout . finally , expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes ( although the edison / pg & e v . cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here ) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants . no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets , which are currently valued at approximately $ 7 - $ 8 billion . all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities ' debts , as some of the money would go to existing bondholders . however , ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer . 3 . long - term contracts as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday , only 500 mw of the 5 , 000 mw of power contracted for can come on - line immediately . much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long - term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some of this will come on - line in approximately two years . assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a " tablet from on high " from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power , not from internal sources or from the market , but through long - term contracts at 7 . 39 cents / kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents to amortize socal edison ' s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period . ( the number is slightly different for pg & e . ) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of $ 7 . 90 in 2001 and $ 5 . 15 in 2005 , and an efficiency heating rate of 10 , 000 - 12 , 000 in 2001 and 7 , 200 in 2005 . these numbers were quoted to industry sources , who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $ 9 . 00 - $ 9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley ' s number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate , but they felt that 7 , 200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line . according to keeley ' s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $ 7 billion rather than $ 12 billion , it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection . a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection . however , since assemblyman keeley ' s numbers are unrealistic , a rate increase will be necessary . 4 . air quality district exemptions there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd ( air quality management district ) regulations - - ab 20 x , ab 28 x , ab 31 x . also , republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government . currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow " dirtier " plants to come on - line . however , there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the use of credits ( this apparently drives up the cost of gas - fired power ) . 5 . democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates the moderate left ( sen . burton , the puc , consumer activists ) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement . this is not just because of his initiative . more important from their perspective , his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election . thus , democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout . 6 . eminent domain would have a limited effect the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited . they only apply to california suppliers . a federal order would be needed to seize assets from out - of - state suppliers . there are also canadian suppliers ( such as bc hydro ) who are essentially untouchable . 7 . smaller ipps feeling the squeeze many of the smaller ipps , which account for approximately 2500 mw of production , appear to be within a few days of running out of cash . ab lx may be amended , possibly sometime this week , to give the smaller producers credit support .)

(0020.2001-02-13.kitchen.ham.txt,Subject: california 2 / 13 for questions contact robert johnston at x 39934 . court case denies rate hikes as forecast in our report yesterday , the federal court in los angeles refused to allow the two california utilities to raise rates to recoup undercollections of their power costs since last august . we had expected that the court would rule in favor of the utilities , but push the rate hike question to an appeals court . instead , judge ronald lew refused to rule on the case because of technical considerations and postponed a hearing until march 5 th . the utilities now face an imminent end to creditor forbearance without the prospect of short - term rate hikes . edison reaches the end of its grace period for a $ 200 million payment today and a $ 600 million payment on thursday . absent the political cover of the court to impose rate hikes , the governor and the state legislature are in an equally tenuous position . bankruptcy grows more likely regardless of the legal technicalities , the bottom line is the same . as we have cautioned since last wednesday , there is a serious risk that a creditor or group of creditors could push for bankruptcy , perhapsas soon as tomorrow when the period of forbearance agreed to by financial creditors runs out . before this ruling , there was reasonable assurance that the utilities would be restored to health by their court victory . now there is real fear a coherent deal is unravelling , and that it will not take much for a small group of financial creditors to break ranks . and the prospects for supplier creditors now look much bleaker and more dangerous . and there is an increased temptation for the utilities to declare bankruptcy and take their chances with a judge rather than the california assembly . the politicians will try to find a way to prevent bankruptcy , but it will now be difficult . disarray in the legislature for now , the only card still being played is the " i give you a dollar , you give me a hot dog " plan , as state senator burton accurately summed it up . the state pumps money into the utilities in return for some kind of asset - - warrants , transmission lines , whatever , anything that can be brandished in front of the voters as proof that the utilities suffered and paid . but " there is little or no energy among legislators for either of the proposed solutions , " one senior figure in sacramento told our source yesterday afternoon . " legislators are running scared . and i don ' t know of a single legislator in either house , on either side , who has the slightest sympathy for the utiltiies now . they think the utiltiies have either been incompetent or shrewd or both . " the ruling will in all likelihood send officials back to the drawing board . " davis will propose a kind of shadow plan by friday , but there will be no real substance in it . what are we supposed to do in just four days ? there will not be a real substantive plan for three weeks , i think , at the earliest . " that period of uncertainty and lack of energy in the legislature could panic the creditors now . bankruptcy court if davis fails to cobble together a last - minute deal for rate hikes and some kind of purchase of transmission assets , then all parties will have to do a workout in federal bankruptcy court . the most likely scenario ( which we flagged last week ) is that the small ipps file an involuntary bankruptcy against edison , followed possibly by pg & e . involuntary bankruptcy would shield the utilities from creditor lawsuits and temporarily relieve them from debt payments . there is also speculation in the press this morning that some creditors are talking about a ch . 7 or liquidation proceeding , but that cannot yet be confirmed by sources .)

b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries ; c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles and glass manufacturing industries . midstream coverage / origination a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this group ; b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ; c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern interconnect ; d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair , formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join this newly formed business . 2 ) commercial transactions : the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical analysis and upstream asset management . the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership , execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions : a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination . b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining , environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks . c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks . d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend . ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together . we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups . please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north america by working with us to implement these changes .)

(0028.1999-12-16.kaminski.ham.txt,Subject: vince and vasant : here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at the east desk , related to gas transmission : typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay $ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( " shrinkage " ) and 6 . 5 % for overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( " basis " ) , and might call brooklyn and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is $ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow . as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity . also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum ( " it ' s not worth their time to haggle " ) ( there is a further issue of " secondary markets " not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take ( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline , in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts . clayton)

" rather than go through all the hassles they [ dynegy ] had at ferc with the 1998 - 99 package , they let someone else do all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid . that way no one can complain that the procedure was tainted . after all , dynegy has quite a few power plants in california to keep fueled , and all of their current ft on el paso expires at the end of this year . of course , they still could be thwarted if the original negotiated customer matches their bid . it may all sound kind of machiavellian but sort of makes sense . " other sources heavily discounted the chances of dynegy being the new high bidder , pointing out that the company made significantly less than expected this year because san juan / border basis differentials narrowed significantly . a dynegy source indicated that the company was involved in the bidding and lost to duke in the first round . regardless of what happens next year , a marketer noted that the southern california border / san juan basis spread continues to compress as socal gas withdraws from storage and east - of - california utilities exercise their peaking contracts because of cold weather in the rockies and elsewhere in the west . from a december index spread of 29 cents , the border / basin gap was down to about 18 cents wednesday , she said .)

(0021.1999-12-15.kaminski.ham.txt,Subject: gas prices vince - 1 . we can detect " hoarding " of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against the actual inflow . 2 . we can detect " market power " by dissociating the seller from the buyer , distinguishing between the physical " cost " in gas to run the generators and the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis . 3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect " storage " as the difference between inflow and consumption . it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors : hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can " calibrate " the price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding , from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally , flows are " explained " by the model , and can be imputed from prices if necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of the weather . i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a model . clayton)

(0015.2001-02-12.kitchen.ham.txt,Subject: california update 2 / 12 executive summary : the likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60 % . this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below , but also because the 30 - day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week , increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . 1 . utilities vs . cpuc governor davis ' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed . the case will come before the judge on monday , february 12 th . the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities . however , the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ( $ . 01 / kwh ) . this will be left to an appellate court . the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing , by the smaller ipps ( as noted in our reports last week ) or by larger out - of - state generators such as duke , reliant , and dynegy ( as noted in the press this morning ) . this is expected next week or the week after . 2 . prospects for a bailout bill ab 18 x is effectively dead from lack of support . senator burton , despite his public refusals , is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail - out . the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position . they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear . for burton , this is because of his long association with labor unions ; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy . burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him . the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for : bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state , but with some kind of state support ( but less than " full faith and credit of the state of ca , " which would not pass ) . this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills ( e . g . $ . 01 , though the actual amount is not known ) . these bonds would be asset - backed securities , with payment receivable from rate payers . the term of these bonds is unknown ; if the term is made quite long ( e . g . 20 years ) , the associated rate increase could be very small . the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets for a very high price . the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) , sources believe that this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . as noted in an earlier report , the california legislature habitually does not act until things " hit the wall . " it is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton ' s lead and support the bail - out plan . the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature . one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail - out in her central valley district is " 50 to 1 . " however , an involuntary filing ( or the threat thereof ) may be enough to trigger legislative support . it would allow the argument of an " imminent threat " to the people of the state of california . 3 . consumer opposition harvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum . if the referendum fails , he intends to attack individual legislators ( though not john burton , who reportedly has " immunity " from rosenfield ) . some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail - out plan , then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later . however , if the bail - out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill ( rather than put in place by the puc , for example ) , it cannot be reversed by a referendum . as additional insurance against rosenfield , by supporting the bonds issued under the plan , the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan . while it is not clear that this is a factual argument , it still might impede any referendum .)

(0008.2004-08-01.BG.spam.txt,Subject: slotting order confirmation may 18 , 2004 etacitne { % begin _ split 76 % } the rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the train . i am afraid to say how many baggage - waggons followed the engine , certainly a score ; then came the chinese , then we , then the families , and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what , if i have it rightly , is called his caboose . the class to which i belonged was of course far the largest , and we ran over , so to speak , to both sides ; so that there were some caucasians among the chinamen , and some bachelors among the families . but our own car was pure from admixture , save for one little boy of eight or nine who had the whooping - cough . at last , about six , the long train crawled out of the transfer station and across the wide missouri river to omaha , westward bound . it was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars . there was thunder in the air , which helped to keep us restless . a man played many airs upon the cornet , and none of them were much attended to , until he came to " home , sweet home . " it was truly strange to note how the talk ceased at that , and the faces began to lengthen . i have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good or bad ; but it belongs to that class of art which may be best described as a brutal assault upon the feelings . pathos must be relieved by dignity of treatment . if you wallow naked in the pathetic , like the author of " home , sweet home , " you make your hearers weep in an unmanly fashion ; and even while yet they are moved , they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their weakness . it did not come to tears that night , for the experiment was interrupted . an elderly , hard - looking man , with a goatee beard and about as much appearance of sentiment an you would expect from a retired slaver , turned with a start and bade the performer stop that " damned thing . " " i ' ve heard about enough of that , " he added ; " give us something about the good country we ' re going to . " a murmur of adhesion ran round the car ; the performer took the instrument from his lips , laughed and nodded , and then struck into a dancing measure ; and , like a new timotheus , stilled immediately the emotion he had raised . aka : vicqodin , xacnax , suprervisagra and much morne - no presccription neyeded ! civilizirano gullweig gxol sylg the day faded ; the lamps were lit ; a party of ht ht men , who got off next evening at north platte , stood together on the stern platform , singing " the sweet by - and - bye " with very tuneful voices ; the chums began to put up their beds ; and it seemed as if the business of the day were at an end . but it was not so ; for , the train stopping at some station , the cars were instantly thronged with the natives , wives and fathers , ht men and maidens , some of them in little more than nightgear , some with stable lanterns , and all offering beds for sale . their charge began with twenty - five cents a cushion , but fell , before the train went on again , to fifteen , with the bed - board gratis , or less than one - fifth of what i had paid for mine at the transfer . this is my contribution to the economy of future emigrants . a great personage on an american train is the newsboy . he sells books ( such books ! ) , papers , fruit , lollipops , and cigars ; and on emigrant journeys , soap , towels , tin washing dishes , tin coffee pitchers , coffee , tea , sugar , and tinned eatables , mostly hash or beans and bacon . early next morning the newsboy went around the cars , and chumming on a more extended principle became the order of the hour . it requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds ; but washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a syndicate of three . i myself entered a little after sunrise into articles of agreement , and became one of the firm of pennsylvania , shakespeare , and dubuque . shakespeare was my own nickname on the cars ; pennsylvania that of my bedfellow ; and dubuque , the name of a place in the state of iowa , that of an amiable ht fellow going west to cure an asthma , and retarding his recovery by incessantly chewing or smoking , and sometimes chewing and smoking together . i have never seen tobacco so sillily abused . shakespeare bought a tin washing - dish , dubuque a towel , and pennsylvania a brick of soap . the partners used these instruments , one after another , according to the order of their first awaking ; and when the firm had finished there was no want of borrowers . each filled the tin dish at the water filter opposite the stove , and retired with the whole stock in trade to the platform of the car . there he knelt down , supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one elbow crooked about the railing , and made a shift to wash his face and neck and hands ; a cold , an insufficient , and , if the train is moving rapidly , a somewhat dangerous toilet .)

" 3 . content window this is the brain of the website . make sure that the text here is easy to read and understand . also , provide your own original content . people do not want to hear what somebody else has to say . they want to hear what you want to say ! while it might be time consuming to write your own content , it sure is worth it . to find content for your website , try searching at ezinearticles ( http : / / www . ezinearticles . com ) . other people may have used the articles , but if you become good friends with the authors , they may send you new content as they write it . be careful though . do not use too much content from other authors , as mentioned above . 4 . font ( s ) several types of fonts exist . the first one i will discuss is fixed width or monospace , similar to courier or courier new . fixed width fonts are good for displaying code ( like html . ) another type of font is called sans serif . it is similar to arial ( windows ) or helvetica ( macintosh ) . this font can be used for long pieces of text . the final type of font is called serif because it has serifs , or curves , in each letter . often , this font is called times ( windows ) or georgia ( macintosh ) . this font , like sans serif , is often used for long blocks of text . it is preferred because its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter , making it easier to read . 5 . advertising ah , everybody ' s favorite . . . advertising ! this is one of thing that almost every website has . the most common type is what is known as " banner " advertising . it is called that because it is long and thin ( like a paper banner . ) how long you ask ? the generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high . new sizes however are being used . take for example the new style called " skyscraper " - - so called for a reason : it looks like a skyscraper . it is tall ( about 425 pixels ) but not too wide ( about 100 - 125 pixels . ) finding a way to place advertising can be tricky . banners used to be placed ( and still are ) only at the top of the page . nevertheless , banners are starting to be placed in the middle of the page , at the bottom , or along the side . conclusion these are only five things to consider when designing a website . there are many others however . let me know what you find that helps you create a unique website . my email address is mailto : corbb @ justforwebmasters . com . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - about the author . . . written by corbb o ' connor . corbb is the webmaster of http : / / www . justforwebmasters . com , a website that focuses on teaching webmasters how to create , gain traffic to , and make money from their own websites . he is also the editor of a free bi - weekly newsletter entitled , " the guided webmaster .

" , i have to blush & say . . . persistence and personality . of course , i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret . clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable . it ' s not years of digging to find the " secrets " to internet riches . one thing that " gets to me " so often in my work as an internet consultant , author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net . it ' s almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture , that " success " is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall . it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! ! long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking the bank . get it ! ! http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ?

" it effectively creates interest and further establishes the point . 3 ) create an interest in the reader from the very first line . your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more . go back to the beginning of this article . the first words were , " it ' s true . " i can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought " what ' s true ? " immediately , your mind wanted to know what i was talking about . before you even knew it you were right here , 8 paragraphs into this article . carefully craft your first line . if you can immediately get them wanting to know more , you ' ve got a winner . 4 ) use bullets . people spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists . in fact , they often reread them over and over . use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service , to spell out exactly what is included in your offer . use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list . 5 ) launch into a bullet list immediately . shortly after your opening line , immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb . hit them with your best shot . pull out the big guns and stress " just a few of " the most important things the reader will discover . by offering a killer list early in your sales letter , you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy . after all , if they are already interested after the first list of benefits , they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them . 6 ) just let it all flow out . write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter . you can edit it later . if you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer , you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind . write it all down . then read through it - you ' ll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points . edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas . 7 ) make your sales letter personal . make sure that the words " you " and " your " are at least 4 : 1 over " i " and " my . " your ad copy must be written about your customer not yourself . i ' m not sure how the old advertising adage goes , but it ' s something like this , " i don ' t care a thing about your lawn mower , i just care about my lawn . " leads aren ' t interested in you or your products , they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs . when you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage , run a check at http : / / www . keywordcount . com and see what the ratio between " you " and " your " versus references to " i , " " me , " " my , " etc . it ' s a free service . make sure it ' s at least 4 : 1 in favor of the customer . 8 ) write like you speak . forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you . write your sales letters in everyday language , just like you would talk in person . don ' t be afraid to begin sentences with " and " or " because . " don ' t worry about ending a sentence with a preposition . write like you speak . your sales letter isn ' t the great american novel , so don ' t write it like you are ernest hemingway . 9 ) use short paragraphs consisting of 2 - 4 sentences each . long copy works . . . but long paragraphs do not . use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph . don ' t be afraid to use short sentences . like this one . or this . see what i mean ? shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader . longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted . 10 ) stress the benefits , not the features . again , readers want the burning question answered , " what ' s in it for me ? " what need is it going to meet ? what want is it going to fill ? how is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader ? spell it out . don ' t focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader . for example : if you are selling automobile tires , you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world , but who cares ? i don ' t care about your selection . but , i do care about keeping my 3 - month - old baby girl safe while we are traveling . so , instead of focusing on your selection , you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car . you ' re not selling tires , you ' re selling safety for my family . stress the benefits , not the features . 11 ) keep the reader interested . some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how i can perform some complicated surgery on my wife . they are filled with words and phrases that i need a dictionary to understand . unless you are writing to a very targeted audience , avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand . keep it simple , using words , language and information that are easy to understand and follow . 12 ) target your sales letter . when you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter , target it to a specific audience . for example : if you are selling a " work at home " product , then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers . then , rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students . write another letter targeting senior citizens . still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation . the possibilities are endless . all you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience . " work only 5 hours a week , " would become " college students , work only 5 hours a week . " your sales letter is now targeted . upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website ( you could easily target 100 ' s of groups ) . then , simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums . you could advertise the " college students " page in a campus ezine . the " senior citizens " page could be advertised at a retirement community message board . by creating these targeted sales letters , you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to . and , in their eyes , it looks like the product was a match made for them . 13 ) make your ad copy easy to follow . use short sentences and paragraphs . break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph . one thing that i have always found to work very well in sales letters . . . . . . is to use a pause like this . start the sentence on one line , leaving the reader wanting to know more , and then finishing up on the next line . also , if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website , use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking . " let ' s get you started down the road to success , shall we ? click here to continue . " 14 ) use similes and metaphors for effect . when the customer purchases your product , they will generate " a flood of traffic that would make noah start building another ark . " if they do not order today , then they will " feel like a cat that let the mouse get away . " use words to create a picture in the readers ' mind . when you think of superman , what comes to mind ? immediately , we remember that he is " faster than a speeding bullet . " " more powerful than a locomotive . " " able to leap tall buildings in a single bound . " see how word pictures stick in our minds ? 15 ) focus on one product or service . don ' t try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time . it only confuses the reader . keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service . then , use other products and services as back - end products . 16 ) make it stand out . don ' t kid yourself . there are hundreds , maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing . how will you stand out among the crowd ? your sales letter must inject personality . it must breathe of originality . your product or service is different . it ' s not like all of the rest . it is unique . right ? your sales letter must separate you from the competition . it must create a feeling of " you won ' t find this anywhere else . " 17 ) be believable . " earn $ 54 , 000 in the next 24 hours ! ! ! " delete . good grief , do they think i am an idiot or something ? get real . don ' t make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth . you ' ll ruin your reputation . let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed . once you have been branded a liar , you will never be anything but a liar . it doesn ' t matter if you launch the most respectable , honest business available anywhere , people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you ' ve said before . be believable . don ' t exaggerate , mislead , stretch or distort the truth . 18 ) be specific . don ' t generalize your information , but rather be exact . instead of " over 100 tips for losing weight " use " 124 tips for losing weight . " by generalizing information , it creates doubt and questions in the reader ' s mind . " what am i really getting here ? does he even know ? " when you use specific information , the reader begins to think , " this person must have counted . i know exactly what i can expect . " " platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck , " wrote claude hopkins in his classic book " scientific advertising . " " they leave no impression whatsoever . " 19 ) be complete . tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service . answer all of their questions , anything they would want to consider before making a purchase . think about it from their point of view . ask yourself , " why wouldn ' t i buy this ? " then , address that in your sales letter . remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase . 20 ) use testimonials to boost your sales . share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service . many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed . satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader . " if these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product , then i probably will too . " especially effective are testimonials from respected , well known " authorities " within your target field . 21 ) use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter . a headline isn ' t just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy . use them frequently - but don ' t overuse . a well - placed headline re - grabs the reader ' s attention , brings them deeper into the letter , and readies them for the next paragraph . you will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter . they are that important . 22 ) avoid asking stupid questions . " wouldn ' t you like to make $ 1 , 000 , 000 a year ? " " doesn ' t that sound great ? " " would you like to be as successful as i am ? " avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior . 23 ) offer a freebie even if the customer doesn ' t buy . if the customer decides he or she isn ' t going to make a purchase , then you want to follow - up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future . by offering a free item , you can request their email address in order to obtain the freebie . by doing this , you can now follow - up with the customer for a potential future sale . additionally , you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy , banners , flyers , etc . within the free item . and , of course , if your free item is a high quality , useful product or service which impresses the customer , they probably will be back as a customer soon . 24 ) use bonuses to overwhelm the reader . one of the things that i have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that out - value the actual product i am offering . ginsu made this one famous . they were selling a set of steak knives , but before the commercial was finished , you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse . make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless , outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer . 25 ) use connective phrases like " but wait , there ' s more " and " but that ' s not all . " these phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next , particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits , or leads into bonus items . again , the idea is more and more value and benefits to the reader . 26 ) always include a deadline . by including a deadline , you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer . " if i don ' t order within 24 hours , then i won ' t get the bonuses . " " oh no , there are only 10 items remaining , i ' ve got to hurry . " let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don ' t make the deadline . remember , they won ' t miss out on your products or bonuses , they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products . deadlines are very effective . every sales letter should have one . 27 ) tell them exactly how to order . be clear as to the order process . point them towards the order link . tell them what methods you offer . ( i . e . credit cards , checks , etc . ) make this process as simple and clear as can be . if it takes more than 2 steps , most people won ' t continue . 28 ) explain when the product will be delivered . how quickly will the order be processed ? when will the order be available ? let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order . the more specific you can be here , the better . let them know that you have a system in place . " operators are standing by . " their order will be handled properly . tell them . 29 ) offer a money back guarantee . take away their last reason to hold back . offer a " no questions asked " 30 day guarantee . most people may not realize this , but in most cases , it ' s the law of the land . you are required to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service . since it ' s the law anyway , why not make it a benefit . let them know that they are purchasing your product or service risk - free . 30 ) instruct them to respond immediately . many people just need to read those words , " act now ! " " order today ! " " click here to instantly place your order . " you ' ve got them this far , now tell them what you want them to do . get them to " act fast ! " have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn ' t prompt the viewer to order right way ? 31 ) include a post script . people will always read the p . s . always . in fact , the p . s . is one of the most important parts of your sales letter . why ? because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost . a p . s . is a perfect place to recap your offer , so when they see your price tag , they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money . use your p . s . to restate your offer in detail . 32 ) include a second post script . you better believe if they read the first p . s . , they will read a p . p . s . use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order . i guarantee you they will read it . use these 32 tips and i guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters . in fact , it would be impossible for your responses to not improve . copyright 2000 jimmy d . brown . all rights reserved worldwide . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - about the author . . . jimmy d . brown is helping average people get out of the rat - race and earn a full - time living online . for more details on firing your boss and creating your own internet wealth , visit us right now at : * special offer : join the profits vault through the above link and email me your receipt and you can have a free bonus copy of the terrific manual - how to profit from free ebooks guaranteed which i sell at : = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = member showcase = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = examine carefully - those with email addresses included will trade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them . there are many ways to build a successful business - just look at these successful sites programs other members are involved in . . . affiliates of the world ! top rated affiliate programs , excellent business opportunities , great marketing resources and free advertising for you ! visit the site to trade links . http : / / www . affiliates . uk . com trade links - adrianbold @ affiliates . uk . com get insane amounts of traffic to your website . purchase 10 , 000 guaranteed visitors to your site and receive 5 , 000 free . more traffic = more money ! less than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited . order now ! http : / / www . freepicklotto . com trade links - businessopps @ aol . com celebration sale ! $ 99 . 00 on casinos / sportsbetting sites , lingerie stores , gift stores , adult sites toy stores . mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price . order now ! http : / / www . cyberopps . com / ?

im 7517 _ bybtb . but , the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your online venture a success . and , yes , rick & i come from the same school of " self marketing " - marketing you ! obviously , that ' s the core of his excellent new ebook , and i couldn ' t agree with him more . point being , * you * are everything you do online to succeed . you are your web site , your business , your marketing piece , your customer service , your customers ' experiences with your business - - all of it , is you ! read his ebook & you ' ll see more of what i ' m saying . the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have standing high as you can see , blocking the path between you & internet success . listen to me - it is not real ok ? it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! ! what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself . when you realize this , you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * , which is the only " real " place it ever was anyhow ! yes , " persistence and personality " inherently includes honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable , powerful key to your success . . . is you ! that may be the most incredible " secret " we ever uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it . talk about simple ! ! bryan is a " veteran " internet consultant , author , internet success strategist & marketer . he publishes mega - success . com chronicles to over 11 , 500 subscribing members , authors articles which appear all over the net , and helps hundreds of wealth - hungry people in their journey to internet success . bryan is also director of his no bs guerrilla internet marketing group at http : / / . com & a fantastic new joint venture partners program for that site . bryan hall is a founding member and the development consultant for the prestigious icop ( tm ) at http : / / www . i - cop . org / 1016 . htm you can reach bryan at 877 . 230 . 3267 or by emailing him directly at bryan . hall @ mega - success . com = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = member showcase = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = examine carefully - those with email addresses included will trade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them . there are many ways to build a successful business - just look at these successful sites programs other members are involved in . . . get insane amounts of traffic to your website . purchase 10 , 000 guaranteed visitors to your site and receive 5 , 000 free . more traffic = more money ! less than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited . order now ! http : / / www . freepicklotto . com trade links - businessopps @ aol . com stop smoking - free lesson ! ! discover the secret to stopping smoking . to master these powerful techniques , come to http : / / www . breath - of - life . net for your free lesson . act now ! p . s . tell someone you care about . trade links - jturco 3 @ hotmail . com celebration sale ! $ 99 . 00 on casinos / sportsbetting sites , lingerie stores , gift stores , adult sites toy stores . mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price . order now ! http : / / www . cyberopps . com / ?
